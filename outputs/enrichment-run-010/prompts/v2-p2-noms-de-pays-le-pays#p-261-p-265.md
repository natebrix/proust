You are annotating a French passage from Marcel Proust's *À la recherche du temps perdu* for **local appraisal events** and **character status effects**.

Your purpose is to generate structured literary-social annotations that can later be transformed into different notions of "winning" and "losing."
Do **not** reduce the passage to a single winner-loser verdict unless the evidence is overwhelmingly explicit.
Instead, identify the **dominant local evaluative acts** and their consequences for the named characters.

## Inputs

You will be given:

1. A French passage. The text is Proust's original, unaltered.
2. A **reference sheet** of known characters and their surface forms for this
   chapter, including a small reviewed set of individuated unnamed figures
   (e.g. l'amie de Mlle Vinteuil) and resolution notes for family references
   ("ma grand'mère", "maman").
3. Optionally, brief prior context from the immediately preceding window.

## Scope rules

* The reference sheet is **advisory context, not a constraint on who exists**.
  When a referent in the passage matches an entry, use that entry's canonical
  name.
* List **every named character materially involved** in the passage's
  evaluative or social dynamics — including characters **not** on the
  reference sheet. For those, use the passage's surface form verbatim as
  `canonical_name` and add `"resolution": "unresolved"` to their
  `characters_present` entry.
* Unnamed figures are included only when they appear on the reference sheet
  as reviewed entries; do not invent descriptor-identified characters beyond
  the sheet.
* Work primarily from the passage itself.
* Use prior context only for local disambiguation of references, not for broad plot inference.
* Do not invent motives, unstated events, or long-run arc interpretations.
* Prefer the **smallest sufficient reading** of the passage.

## What to detect

Track local shifts in how named characters are positioned through:

* praise
* blame
* admiration
* snub
* prestige by association
* discredit by association
* narrated elevation or diminishment
* inclusion in or exclusion from valued social space
* signs that another character depends on, yields to, or dismisses them

For this first pass, prefer **broad, stable categories** over fine-grained distinctions.
Do not split one local movement into multiple event labels unless the passage clearly stages them as distinct.

## Interpretive principles

A character may come out ahead or behind in several ways:

* directly, by being praised or insulted
* comparatively, by being favored over another
* socially, by being included, deferred to, or excluded
* rhetorically, by speaking with force, wit, authority, or discernment
* emotionally, by gaining leverage over another character
* associationally, by benefiting from or suffering through a linked person
* narratively, through a passage that appears to elevate or diminish them

Do **not** judge:

* morality
* factual correctness
* long-term importance
* whether the character "deserves" the treatment

Judge only the **local evaluative and social dynamics** of the supplied passage.

## Special caution for Proust

Proust often layers evaluation through:

* quoted speech
* free indirect style
* remembered perception
* irony
* narrator distance
* social codes that are reported rather than endorsed

For every evaluative event, distinguish:

* who is making the evaluation
* who is its target
* whether the passage appears to endorse, neutrally report, ironize, or leave uncertain that evaluation

## Special rule for consummation and renewal

In erotic or affective passages, distinguish between:

* the mode of attainment
* the attained local outcome

Timidity, dependence, awkwardness, compromise, or ironic framing may qualify how an outcome is reached, but they do **not** by themselves override a plainly successful local outcome.

If the passage culminates in any of the following, that dominant positive movement must be represented in the annotation:

* realized intimacy
* mutual receptivity
* successful consummation
* narrator-endorsed emotional renewal

Do **not** collapse such passages into pure diminishment merely because the path to that outcome is hesitant, dependent, socially compromising, or lightly ironized.
When both weakness and successful renewal coexist, preserve the dominant local success and mention the qualifying weakness only if it is central.
Do **not** treat mere reunion, temporary relief, or the end of uncertainty as equivalent to consummation or renewal.
Relief at finding the desired person again counts as dominant positive movement only if the passage itself goes on to show realized intimacy, mutual receptivity, or an explicitly narrator-endorsed affective transformation.
Weigh the passage as a whole rather than over-privileging its final sentence or final image.
Do **not** let a single upbeat note, however striking or late-placed, outweigh a passage whose dominant body is organized around anxious search, dependency, agitation, jealousy, or diminishment unless the passage is plainly structured so that the culmination redefines the whole local movement.
If most of the passage is governed by distress and only a brief closing note offers relief, prefer a mixed or negative reading unless the text clearly presents that closing turn as the main narrated point.

## Task

1. Identify only the named characters who are materially involved in the dominant local movement.
2. Extract only the **significant** appraisal or status-relevant events.
3. Record only the dominant local status effects for the characters involved.
4. Note ambiguity only when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
5. Multiple characters may gain or lose simultaneously.
6. If there is no meaningful status movement, return empty `appraisal_events` and empty `status_effects`.
7. Prefer fewer, high-quality events over many trivial ones.
8. Default to **1 main event** for a passage.
9. Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct, non-redundant local movements.
10. A dense social scene — several characters, several separately witnessed movements — may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct movement that the others do not cover. Never return more than **4 appraisal events**.
11. Do not add balancing or countervailing events unless they are central to the passage.
12. For one character: at most **one status effect per dimension**. A second effect in the same dimension is allowed only for clearly separate moments of the passage, each citing different `based_on_events`.
13. For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position` — these are facets of the same contest; choose the dimension that best names the movement. The same event may additionally ground a `social_status` or `inclusion_exclusion` effect for that character when that dimension's own criterion is independently met.

## Schema guidance

Use a reduced first-pass schema.

Do not add fields beyond the schema above.

### `characters_present`

Include only named characters who are either:

* explicitly mentioned in the passage
* clearly implicated by nearby reference in the passage or optional prior context

Do **not** include every discourse participant.
Include a character only if omitting them would distort the dominant local appraisal or status movement.
Peripheral parents, relatives, or bystanders should usually be omitted in this first pass.

### `appraisal_events`

Record only significant local evaluative or status-relevant events.

Prefer fewer, stronger events over exhaustive tagging.
Default to **1 event**.
Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct movements that are both central.
A dense social scene may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct
witnessed movement that the others do not cover — a salon may snub one guest,
crown another, and watch a third fall in the same evening. This is not license
to fragment: every "bad reason to create an event" below still applies, and an
event that merely restates or elaborates another must not be added.
Never emit more than **4 events** total.

Good reasons to create an event:

* one character is praised, admired, deferred to, or favored
* one character is blamed, ridiculed, excluded, snubbed, or diminished
* a comparison clearly puts one character above or below another
* a character gains or loses rhetorical or emotional leverage
* association with another figure clearly raises or lowers local standing

Bad reasons to create a separate event:

* a subordinate nuance merely restates the same local movement
* a quoted phrase provides color but not a distinct appraisal act
* a possible counter-reading is present but not central
* a nearby character is involved in the scene but not in the main evaluative movement
* one sentence offers several pieces of evidence for the same local movement
* the same movement could be described with several nearby labels

Prefer these broad labels when possible:

* `narrated_diminishment`
* `narrated_elevation`
* `snub`
* `admiration`
* `blame`
* `prestige_association`
* `discredit_association`

Avoid finer-grained labels unless the passage truly demands them.
Choose the **single best label** for the dominant movement rather than enumerating nearby alternatives.

### `status_effects`

Use these dimensions only. Each is governed by its own criterion:

* `general_appraisal` — the passage's evaluative verdict on a character:
  praised, admired, ridiculed, or discredited in the narration or the scene.
* `rhetorical_position` — the upper hand in talk: wit that lands or misfires,
  an argument won or lost, a line that silences or is silenced.
* `emotional_position` — emotional leverage in a relation: who needs, who
  withholds, who suffers visibly, who controls.
* `social_status` — a movement or display of standing that is **witnessed
  inside the world of the passage**. Someone present — or society's reported
  voice — must register it: deference given or withheld, a reception or
  invitation that marks rank, a public snub, a reputation spoken of as risen
  or fallen. A private, unshared judgment of a character is
  `general_appraisal`, not `social_status`.
* `inclusion_exclusion` — a **boundary event**: an interior with an
  exterior, and a character shown crossing that line or barred at it —
  introduced or not introduced, greeted or cut, invited or left out, absorbed
  into the group or held at its edge. The boundary need not belong to a
  social set: the family table, a household, a bedroom door, a clan, a club,
  a box at the theatre, the circle of a conversation, the intimacy of
  tutoiement, an institution, a nation, a clandestine fraternity — all count,
  so long as the passage shows an inside, an outside, and this character's
  position across that line changing. Mere
  presence at a gathering is not inclusion, and absence is not exclusion;
  the boundary itself must be shown moving for this character.

Create status effects only when there is meaningful local movement.
Record **every distinct movement that meets its dimension's criterion**.
Most characters will still have 1 status effect, some 2; a dense social
scene may genuinely support more. There is no fixed cap, but distinctness
is strict:

* Two effects in the **same dimension** for one character are allowed only
  when they arise from clearly separate moments of the passage — different
  events, different witnesses, a different boundary — and could not honestly
  be summarized as one movement. Each must cite different `based_on_events`.
  When in doubt, summarize as one.
* Never restate one social fact as several effects.
* For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among
  `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position`:
  these are facets of the same contest, so choose the dimension that best
  names the movement rather than recording several facets of it.
* An event supports a dimension only when it meets that dimension's
  criterion, not when it merely brushes it.
* Do not collapse a real standing or belonging movement into
  `general_appraisal` to economize: a witticism that wins the room may be
  both `rhetorical_position` for the duel and `social_status` for the
  standing it visibly confers — record each on its own merits.

`delta` should reflect local movement in the passage:

Status delta:

* -2 = clearly diminished in this passage
* -1 = somewhat diminished
* 0 = do not use — if there is no clear movement, record no effect at all: null is not zero
* +1 = somewhat elevated
* +2 = clearly elevated

### `ambiguities`

Use this list to record uncertainty such as:

* ironic or layered narration
* uncertain evaluator
* ambiguous target
* uncertain reference resolution (who a surface form refers to)
* unclear endorsement by narrator or social voice

Default to an empty list.
Only add an ambiguity when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
Do not use `ambiguities` for routine caveats or general interpretive hedging.
Usually return an empty list.

### Confidence

* 0.0 to 1.0
* Be conservative when irony, layered narration, or reference resolution makes interpretation unstable.

## Important rules

* Named characters, plus only the reviewed unnamed figures on the reference sheet.
* Use the reference sheet's canonical names where a referent matches; use the
  passage's surface form verbatim with `"resolution": "unresolved"` where it
  does not. Never silently drop a materially involved character.
* `"resolution": "resolved"` may be omitted (it is the default); always state
  `"resolution": "unresolved"` explicitly.
* If a surface form is ambiguous, mention that in "ambiguities."
* Do not infer broad character arcs.
* Do not force zero-sum logic.
* A single event may affect both source and target, but record that through separate status effects if needed.
* Ignore trivial mentions that do not meaningfully alter evaluation or status.
* Do not add a winner/loser verdict field.
* Do not add a summary object.
* If there is no meaningful status movement, keep `appraisal_events` and `status_effects` empty rather than inventing a weak event.
* When narrator framing clearly guides the judgment, do not default to `neutral_report`.
* Do not turn one dominant movement into a chain of micro-events.
* Do not add balancing positive and negative effects unless both are central to the passage.
* Do not annotate every evaluatively charged phrase.
* Multiple quotations can support one event.
* If you are unsure between several event labels, pick the broadest stable one.

## Compression examples

These examples illustrate the intended first-pass compression.

Example A:

If a passage reveals that Swann is far more socially eminent than the family realizes, do **not** split this into:

* one event for narrator elevation
* one event for aristocratic association
* one event for local under-recognition

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_elevation`
* `1` main status effect: `social_status +2`

Example B:

If a passage exposes Legrandin’s evasive, socially defensive performance, do **not** split this into:

* ridicule
* humiliation
* blame
* rhetorical weakness
* emotional vulnerability

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_diminishment`
* `1` or `2` status effects at most, only if both are central

Example C:

If a passage shows Swann reaching long-desired intimacy with Odette through awkward pretext, hesitation, or dependence, do **not** reduce it to:

* one event for timidity
* one event for dependence
* one event for social compromise

Instead, prefer:

* `1` central event that preserves the realized intimacy or renewal
* a positive `emotional_position` effect when that attainment is the dominant local outcome
* a secondary note about hesitation or compromise only if it is itself central
* do **not** promote mere reunion relief unless the passage clearly crosses into intimacy or explicit renewal
* do **not** let a brief closing uplift outweigh the dominant movement of the passage unless that culminating turn is clearly the passage's main point

Example D:

If a passage shows a guest turned away at a hostess's door and then dwells
on that same refusal — the guest's confusion, the footman's repeated
message, the slow walk back down the staircase — that is **one** boundary
event:

* `1` event: `snub`
* `1` status effect: `inclusion_exclusion -2`

But if the same passage later shows the assembled room deferring to a newly
arrived title, that is a separate witnessed movement, for a different
character, grounded in its own event — record it on its own merits.

### Prior local context (optional)

J’y fus moi-même pris et à la manière dont M. Bloch père parla de Bergotte, je crus aussi que c’était un de ses vieux amis. Or, tous les gens célèbres, M. Bloch ne les connaissait que « sans les connaître », pour les avoir vus de loin au théâtre, sur les boulevards. Il s’imaginait du reste que sa propre figure, son nom, sa personnalité ne leur étaient pas inconnus et qu’en les apercevant, ils étaient souvent obligés de retenir une furtive envie de le saluer. Les gens du monde, parce qu’ils connaissent les gens de talent original, qu’ils les reçoivent à dîner, ne les comprennent pas mieux pour cela. Mais quand on a un peu vécu dans le monde, la sottise de ses habitants vous fait trop souhaiter de vivre, trop supposer d’intelligence, dans les milieux obscurs où l’on ne connaît que « sans connaître ». J’allais m’en rendre compte en parlant de Bergotte. M. Bloch n’était pas le seul qui eût des succès chez lui. Mon camarade en avait davantage encore auprès de ses sœurs qu’il ne cessait d’interpeller sur un ton bougon, en enfonçant sa tête dans son assiette ; il les faisait ainsi rire aux larmes. Elles avaient d’ailleurs adopté la langue de leur frère qu’elles parlaient couramment, comme si elle eût été obligatoire et la seule dont pussent user des personnes intelligentes. Quand nous arrivâmes, l’aînée dit à une de ses cadettes : « Va prévenir notre père prudent et notre mère vénérable. — Chiennes, leur dit Bloch, je vous présente le cavalier Saint-Loup, aux javelots rapides, qui est venu pour quelques jours de Doncières aux demeures de pierre polie, féconde en chevaux. » Comme il était aussi vulgaire que lettré, le discours se terminait d’habitude par quelque plaisanterie moins homérique : « Voyons, fermez un peu vos peplos aux belles agrafes, qu’est-ce que c’est que ce chichi-là ? Après tout c’est pas mon père ! » Et les demoiselles Bloch s’écroulaient dans une tempête de rires. Je dis à leur frère combien de joies il m’avait données en me recommandant la lecture de Bergotte dont j’avais adoré les livres.

### Passage

M. Bloch père qui ne connaissait Bergotte que de loin, et la vie de Bergotte que par les racontars du parterre, avait une manière tout aussi indirecte de prendre connaissance de ses œuvres, à l’aide de jugements d’apparence littéraire. Il vivait dans le monde des à peu près, où l’on salue dans le vide, où l’on juge dans le faux. L’inexactitude, l’incompétence, n’y diminuent pas l’assurance, au contraire. C’est le miracle bienfaisant de l’amour-propre que peu de gens pouvant avoir les relations brillantes et les connaissances profondes, ceux auxquels elles font défaut se croient encore les mieux partagés parce que l’optique des gradins sociaux fait que tout rang semble le meilleur à celui qui l’occupe et qui voit moins favorisés que lui, mal lotis, à plaindre, les plus grands qu’il nomme et calomnie sans les connaître, juge et dédaigne sans les comprendre. Même dans les cas où la multiplication des faibles avantages personnels par l’amour-propre ne suffirait pas à assurer à chacun la dose de bonheur, supérieure à celle accordée aux autres, qui lui est nécessaire, l’envie est là pour combler la différence. Il est vrai que si l’envie s’exprime en phrases dédaigneuses, il faut traduire : « Je ne veux pas le connaître » par « je ne peux pas le connaître ». C’est le sens intellectuel. Mais le sens passionné est bien : « Je ne veux pas le connaître. » On sait que cela n’est pas vrai mais on ne le dit pas cependant par simple artifice, on le dit parce qu’on éprouve ainsi, et cela suffit pour supprimer la distance, c’est-à-dire pour le bonheur.

L’égocentrisme permettant de la sorte à chaque humain de voir l’univers étagé au-dessous de lui qui est roi, M. Bloch se donnait le luxe d’en être un impitoyable quand le matin en prenant son chocolat, voyant la signature de Bergotte au bas d’un article dans le journal à peine entr’ouvert, il lui accordait dédaigneusement une audience écourtée, prononçait sa sentence, et s’octroyait le confortable plaisir de répéter entre chaque gorgée du breuvage bouillant : « Ce Bergotte est devenu illisible. Ce que cet animal-là peut être embêtant. C’est à se désabonner. Comme c’est emberlificoté ! quelle tartine ! » Et il reprenait une beurrée.

Cette importance illusoire de M. Bloch père était d’ailleurs étendue un peu au delà du cercle de sa propre perception. D’abord ses enfants le considéraient comme un homme supérieur. Les enfants ont toujours une tendance soit à déprécier, soit à exalter leurs parents, et pour un bon fils, son père est toujours le meilleur des pères, en dehors même de toutes raisons objectives de l’admirer. Or celles-ci ne manquaient pas absolument pour M. Bloch, lequel était instruit, fin, affectueux pour les siens. Dans la famille la plus proche, on se plaisait d’autant plus avec lui que si dans la « société », on juge les gens d’après un étalon, d’ailleurs absurde, et selon des règles fausses mais fixes, par comparaison avec la totalité des autres gens élégants, en revanche dans le morcellement de la vie bourgeoise, les dîners, les soirées de famille tournent autour de personnes qu’on déclare agréables, amusantes, et qui dans le monde ne tiendraient pas l’affiche deux soirs. Enfin, dans ce milieu où les grandeurs factices de l’aristocratie n’existent pas, on les remplace par des distinctions plus folles encore. C’est ainsi que pour sa famille et jusqu’à un degré de parenté fort éloigné, une prétendue ressemblance dans la façon de porter la moustache et dans le haut du nez faisait qu’on appelait M. Bloch un « faux duc d’Aumale ». (Dans le monde des « chasseurs » de cercle, l’un qui porte sa casquette de travers et sa vareuse très serrée de manière à se donner l’air, croit-il, d’un officier étranger, n’est-il pas une manière de personnage pour ses camarades ?)

La ressemblance était des plus vagues, mais on eût dit que ce fût un titre. On répétait : « Bloch ? lequel ? le duc d’Aumale ? » Comme on dit : « La princesse Murat ? laquelle ? la Reine (de Naples) ? » Un certain nombre d’autres infimes indices achevaient de lui donner aux yeux du cousinage une prétendue distinction. N’allant pas jusqu’à avoir une voiture, M. Bloch louait à certains jours une victoria découverte à deux chevaux de la Compagnie et traversait le Bois de Boulogne, mollement étendu de travers, deux doigts sur la tempe, deux autres sous le menton et si les gens qui ne le connaissaient pas le trouvaient à cause de cela « faiseur d’embarras », on était persuadé dans la famille que pour le chic, l’oncle Salomon aurait pu en remontrer à Gramont-Caderousse. Il était de ces personnes qui quand elles meurent et à cause d’une table commune avec le rédacteur en chef de cette feuille dans un restaurant des boulevards, sont qualifiées de physionomie bien connue des Parisiens, par la Chronique mondaine du Radical. M. Bloch nous dit à Saint-Loup et à moi que Bergotte savait si bien pourquoi lui, M. Bloch, ne le saluait pas, que dès qu’il l’apercevait au théâtre ou au cercle, il fuyait son regard. Saint-Loup rougit, car il réfléchit que ce cercle ne pouvait pas être le Jockey dont son père avait été président. D’autre part ce devait être un cercle relativement fermé, car M. Bloch avait dit que Bergotte n’y serait plus reçu aujourd’hui. Aussi est-ce en tremblant de « sous-estimer l’adversaire » que Saint-Loup demanda si ce cercle était le cercle de la rue Royale, lequel était jugé « déclassant » par la famille de Saint-Loup et où il savait qu’étaient reçus certains Israélites. « Non, répondit M. Bloch d’un air négligent, fier et honteux, c’est un petit cercle, mais beaucoup plus agréable, le Cercle des Ganaches. On y juge sévèrement la galerie. — Est-ce que sir Rufus Israël n’en est pas président ? » demanda Bloch fils à son père, pour lui fournir l’occasion d’un mensonge honorable et sans se douter que ce financier n’avait pas le même prestige aux yeux de Saint-Loup qu’aux siens. En réalité, il y avait au Cercle des Ganaches non point sir Rufus Israël, mais un de ses employés. Mais comme il était fort bien avec le patron, il avait à sa disposition des cartes du grand financier, et en donnait une à M. Bloch, quand celui-ci partait en voyage sur une ligne dont sir Rufus était administrateur, ce qui faisait dire au père Bloch : « Je vais passer au cercle demander une recommandation de sir Rufus. » Et la carte lui permettait d’éblouir les chefs de train. Les demoiselles Bloch furent plus intéressées par Bergotte et revenant à lui au lieu de poursuivre sur les « Ganaches », la cadette demanda à son frère du ton le plus sérieux du monde car elle croyait qu’il n’existait pas au monde pour désigner les gens de talent d’autres expressions que celles qu’il employait : « Est-ce un coco vraiment étonnant, ce Bergotte ? Est-il de la catégorie des grands bonshommes, des cocos comme Villiers ou Catulle ? — Je l’ai rencontré à plusieurs générales, dit M. Nissim Bernard. Il est gauche, c’est une espèce de Schlemihl. » Cette allusion au conte de Chamisso n’avait rien de bien grave, mais l’épithète de Schlemihl faisait partie de ce dialecte mi-allemand, mi-juif, dont l’emploi ravissait M. Bloch dans l’intimité, mais qu’il trouvait vulgaire et déplacé devant des étrangers. Aussi jeta-t-il un regard sévère sur son oncle. « Il a du talent, dit Bloch. — Ah ! fit gravement sa sœur comme pour dire que dans ces conditions j’étais excusable. — Tous les écrivains ont du talent, dit avec mépris M. Bloch père. — Il paraît même, dit son fils en levant sa fourchette et en plissant ses yeux d’un air diaboliquement ironique, qu’il va se présenter à l’Académie. — Allons donc ! il n’a pas un bagage suffisant, répondit M. Bloch le père qui ne semblait pas avoir pour l’Académie le mépris de son fils et de ses filles. Il n’a pas le calibre nécessaire. — D’ailleurs l’Académie est un salon et Bergotte ne jouit d’aucune surface », déclara l’oncle à héritage de Mme Bloch, personnage inoffensif et doux dont le nom de Bernard eût peut-être à lui seul éveillé les dons de diagnostic de mon grand-père, mais eût paru insuffisamment en harmonie avec un visage qui semblait rapporté du palais de Darius et reconstitué par Mme Dieulafoy, si, choisi par quelque amateur désireux de donner un couronnement oriental à cette figure de Suse, ce prénom de Nissim n’avait fait planer au-dessus d’elle les ailes de quelque taureau androcéphale de Khorsabad. Mais M. Bloch ne cessait d’insulter son oncle, soit qu’il fût excité par la bonhomie sans défense de son souffre-douleur, soit que, la villa étant payée par M. Nissim Bernard, le bénéficiaire voulût montrer qu’il gardait son indépendance et surtout qu’il ne cherchait pas par des cajoleries à s’assurer l’héritage à venir du richard. Celui-ci était surtout froissé qu’on le traitât si grossièrement devant le maître d’hôtel. Il murmura une phrase inintelligible où on distinguait seulement : « Quand les Meschorès sont là ». Meschorès désigne dans la Bible le serviteur de Dieu. Entre eux les Bloch s’en servaient pour désigner les domestiques et en étaient toujours égayés, parce que leur certitude de n’être compris ni des chrétiens ni des domestiques eux-mêmes exaltait chez M. Nissim Bernard et M. Bloch leur double particularisme de « maîtres » et de « juifs ». Mais cette dernière cause de satisfaction en devenait une de mécontentement quand il y avait du monde. Alors M. Bloch entendant son oncle dire « Meschorès » trouvait qu’il laissait trop paraître son côté oriental, de même qu’une cocotte qui invite ses amies avec des gens comme il faut est irritée si elles font allusion à leur métier de cocotte, ou emploient des mots malsonnants. Aussi, bien loin que la prière de son oncle produisît quelque effet sur M. Bloch, celui-ci, hors de lui, ne put plus se contenir. Il ne perdit plus une occasion d’invectiver le malheureux oncle. « Naturellement, quand il y a quelque bêtise prudhommesque à dire, on peut être sûr que vous ne la ratez pas. Vous seriez le premier à lui lécher les pieds s’il était là », cria M. Bloch tandis que M. Nissim Bernard attristé inclinait vers son assiette la barbe annelée du roi Sargon. Mon camarade depuis qu’il portait la sienne qu’il avait aussi crépue et bleutée ressemblait beaucoup à son grand-oncle.

— Comment, vous êtes le fils du marquis de Marsantes ? mais je l’ai très bien connu, dit à Saint-Loup M. Nissim Bernard. Je crus qu’il voulait dire « connu » au sens où le père de Bloch disait qu’il connaissait Bergotte, c’est-à-dire de vue. Mais il ajouta : « Votre père était un de mes bons amis. » Cependant Bloch était devenu excessivement rouge, son père avait l’air profondément contrarié, les demoiselles Bloch riaient en s’étouffant. C’est que chez M. Nissim Bernard le goût de l’ostentation, contenu chez M. Bloch le père et chez ses enfants, avait engendré l’habitude du mensonge perpétuel. Par exemple, en voyage à l’hôtel, M. Nissim Bernard, comme aurait pu faire M. Bloch le père, se faisait apporter tous ses journaux par son valet de chambre dans la salle à manger, au milieu du déjeuner, quand tout le monde était réuni, pour qu’on vît bien qu’il voyageait avec un valet de chambre. Mais aux gens avec qui il se liait dans l’hôtel, l’oncle disait, ce que le neveu n’eût jamais fait, qu’il était sénateur. Il avait beau être certain qu’on apprendrait un jour que le titre était usurpé, il ne pouvait au moment même résister au besoin de se le donner. M. Bloch souffrait beaucoup des mensonges de son oncle et de tous les ennuis qu’ils lui causaient. « Ne faites pas attention, il est extrêmement blagueur, dit-il à mi-voix à Saint-Loup qui n’en fut que plus intéressé, étant très curieux de la psychologie des menteurs. — Plus menteur encore que l’Ithaquesien Odysseus qu’Athènes appelait pourtant le plus menteur des hommes, compléta notre camarade Bloch. — Ah ! par exemple ! s’écria M. Nissim Bernard, si je m’attendais à dîner avec le fils de mon ami ! Mais j’ai à Paris chez moi, une photographie de votre père et combien de lettres de lui. Il m’appelait toujours « mon oncle », on n’a jamais su pourquoi. C’était un homme charmant, étincelant. Je me rappelle un dîner chez moi, à Nice, où il y avait Sardou, Labiche, Augier… — Molière, Racine, Corneille, continua ironiquement M. Bloch le père dont le fils acheva l’énumération en ajoutant : Plaute, Ménandre, Kalidasa. » M. Nissim Bernard blessé arrêta brusquement son récit et, se privant ascétiquement d’un grand plaisir, resta muet jusqu’à la fin du dîner.
