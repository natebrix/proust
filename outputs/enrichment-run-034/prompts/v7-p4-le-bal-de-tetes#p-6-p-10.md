You are annotating a French passage from Marcel Proust's *À la recherche du temps perdu* for **local appraisal events** and **character status effects**.

Your purpose is to generate structured literary-social annotations that can later be transformed into different notions of "winning" and "losing."
Do **not** reduce the passage to a single winner-loser verdict unless the evidence is overwhelmingly explicit.
Instead, identify the **dominant local evaluative acts** and their consequences for the named characters.

## Inputs

You will be given:

1. A French passage. The text is Proust's original, unaltered.
2. A **reference sheet** of known characters and their surface forms for this
   chapter, including a small reviewed set of individuated unnamed figures
   (e.g. l'amie de Mlle Vinteuil) and resolution notes for family references
   ("ma grand'mère", "maman").
3. Optionally, brief prior context from the immediately preceding window.

## Scope rules

* The reference sheet is **advisory context, not a constraint on who exists**.
  When a referent in the passage matches an entry, use that entry's canonical
  name.
* List **every named character materially involved** in the passage's
  evaluative or social dynamics — including characters **not** on the
  reference sheet. For those, use the passage's surface form verbatim as
  `canonical_name` and add `"resolution": "unresolved"` to their
  `characters_present` entry.
* Unnamed figures are included only when they appear on the reference sheet
  as reviewed entries; do not invent descriptor-identified characters beyond
  the sheet.
* Work primarily from the passage itself.
* Use prior context only for local disambiguation of references, not for broad plot inference.
* Do not invent motives, unstated events, or long-run arc interpretations.
* Prefer the **smallest sufficient reading** of the passage.

## What to detect

Track local shifts in how named characters are positioned through:

* praise
* blame
* admiration
* snub
* prestige by association
* discredit by association
* narrated elevation or diminishment
* inclusion in or exclusion from valued social space
* signs that another character depends on, yields to, or dismisses them

For this first pass, prefer **broad, stable categories** over fine-grained distinctions.
Do not split one local movement into multiple event labels unless the passage clearly stages them as distinct.

## Interpretive principles

A character may come out ahead or behind in several ways:

* directly, by being praised or insulted
* comparatively, by being favored over another
* socially, by being included, deferred to, or excluded
* rhetorically, by speaking with force, wit, authority, or discernment
* emotionally, by gaining leverage over another character
* associationally, by benefiting from or suffering through a linked person
* narratively, through a passage that appears to elevate or diminish them

Do **not** judge:

* morality
* factual correctness
* long-term importance
* whether the character "deserves" the treatment

Judge only the **local evaluative and social dynamics** of the supplied passage.

## Special caution for Proust

Proust often layers evaluation through:

* quoted speech
* free indirect style
* remembered perception
* irony
* narrator distance
* social codes that are reported rather than endorsed

For every evaluative event, distinguish:

* who is making the evaluation
* who is its target
* whether the passage appears to endorse, neutrally report, ironize, or leave uncertain that evaluation

## Special rule for consummation and renewal

In erotic or affective passages, distinguish between:

* the mode of attainment
* the attained local outcome

Timidity, dependence, awkwardness, compromise, or ironic framing may qualify how an outcome is reached, but they do **not** by themselves override a plainly successful local outcome.

If the passage culminates in any of the following, that dominant positive movement must be represented in the annotation:

* realized intimacy
* mutual receptivity
* successful consummation
* narrator-endorsed emotional renewal

Do **not** collapse such passages into pure diminishment merely because the path to that outcome is hesitant, dependent, socially compromising, or lightly ironized.
When both weakness and successful renewal coexist, preserve the dominant local success and mention the qualifying weakness only if it is central.
Do **not** treat mere reunion, temporary relief, or the end of uncertainty as equivalent to consummation or renewal.
Relief at finding the desired person again counts as dominant positive movement only if the passage itself goes on to show realized intimacy, mutual receptivity, or an explicitly narrator-endorsed affective transformation.
Weigh the passage as a whole rather than over-privileging its final sentence or final image.
Do **not** let a single upbeat note, however striking or late-placed, outweigh a passage whose dominant body is organized around anxious search, dependency, agitation, jealousy, or diminishment unless the passage is plainly structured so that the culmination redefines the whole local movement.
If most of the passage is governed by distress and only a brief closing note offers relief, prefer a mixed or negative reading unless the text clearly presents that closing turn as the main narrated point.

## Task

1. Identify only the named characters who are materially involved in the dominant local movement.
2. Extract only the **significant** appraisal or status-relevant events.
3. Record only the dominant local status effects for the characters involved.
4. Note ambiguity only when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
5. Multiple characters may gain or lose simultaneously.
6. If there is no meaningful status movement, return empty `appraisal_events` and empty `status_effects`.
7. Prefer fewer, high-quality events over many trivial ones.
8. Default to **1 main event** for a passage.
9. Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct, non-redundant local movements.
10. A dense social scene — several characters, several separately witnessed movements — may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct movement that the others do not cover. Never return more than **4 appraisal events**.
11. Do not add balancing or countervailing events unless they are central to the passage.
12. For one character: at most **one status effect per dimension**. A second effect in the same dimension is allowed only for clearly separate moments of the passage, each citing different `based_on_events`.
13. For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position` — these are facets of the same contest; choose the dimension that best names the movement. The same event may additionally ground a `social_status` or `inclusion_exclusion` effect for that character when that dimension's own criterion is independently met.

## Schema guidance

Use a reduced first-pass schema.

Do not add fields beyond the schema above.

### `characters_present`

Include only named characters who are either:

* explicitly mentioned in the passage
* clearly implicated by nearby reference in the passage or optional prior context

Do **not** include every discourse participant.
Include a character only if omitting them would distort the dominant local appraisal or status movement.
Peripheral parents, relatives, or bystanders should usually be omitted in this first pass.

### `appraisal_events`

Record only significant local evaluative or status-relevant events.

Prefer fewer, stronger events over exhaustive tagging.
Default to **1 event**.
Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct movements that are both central.
A dense social scene may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct
witnessed movement that the others do not cover — a salon may snub one guest,
crown another, and watch a third fall in the same evening. This is not license
to fragment: every "bad reason to create an event" below still applies, and an
event that merely restates or elaborates another must not be added.
Never emit more than **4 events** total.

Good reasons to create an event:

* one character is praised, admired, deferred to, or favored
* one character is blamed, ridiculed, excluded, snubbed, or diminished
* a comparison clearly puts one character above or below another
* a character gains or loses rhetorical or emotional leverage
* association with another figure clearly raises or lowers local standing

Bad reasons to create a separate event:

* a subordinate nuance merely restates the same local movement
* a quoted phrase provides color but not a distinct appraisal act
* a possible counter-reading is present but not central
* a nearby character is involved in the scene but not in the main evaluative movement
* one sentence offers several pieces of evidence for the same local movement
* the same movement could be described with several nearby labels

Prefer these broad labels when possible:

* `narrated_diminishment`
* `narrated_elevation`
* `snub`
* `admiration`
* `blame`
* `prestige_association`
* `discredit_association`

Avoid finer-grained labels unless the passage truly demands them.
Choose the **single best label** for the dominant movement rather than enumerating nearby alternatives.

### `status_effects`

Use these dimensions only. Each is governed by its own criterion:

* `general_appraisal` — the passage's evaluative verdict on a character:
  praised, admired, ridiculed, or discredited in the narration or the scene.
* `rhetorical_position` — the upper hand in talk: wit that lands or misfires,
  an argument won or lost, a line that silences or is silenced.
* `emotional_position` — emotional leverage in a relation: who needs, who
  withholds, who suffers visibly, who controls.
* `social_status` — a movement or display of standing that is **witnessed
  inside the world of the passage**. Someone present — or society's reported
  voice — must register it: deference given or withheld, a reception or
  invitation that marks rank, a public snub, a reputation spoken of as risen
  or fallen. A private, unshared judgment of a character is
  `general_appraisal`, not `social_status`.
* `inclusion_exclusion` — a **boundary event**: an interior with an
  exterior, and a character shown crossing that line or barred at it —
  introduced or not introduced, greeted or cut, invited or left out, absorbed
  into the group or held at its edge. The boundary need not belong to a
  social set: the family table, a household, a bedroom door, a clan, a club,
  a box at the theatre, the circle of a conversation, the intimacy of
  tutoiement, an institution, a nation, a clandestine fraternity — all count,
  so long as the passage shows an inside, an outside, and this character's
  position across that line changing. Mere
  presence at a gathering is not inclusion, and absence is not exclusion;
  the boundary itself must be shown moving for this character.

Create status effects only when there is meaningful local movement.
Record **every distinct movement that meets its dimension's criterion**.
Most characters will still have 1 status effect, some 2; a dense social
scene may genuinely support more. There is no fixed cap, but distinctness
is strict:

* Two effects in the **same dimension** for one character are allowed only
  when they arise from clearly separate moments of the passage — different
  events, different witnesses, a different boundary — and could not honestly
  be summarized as one movement. Each must cite different `based_on_events`.
  When in doubt, summarize as one.
* Never restate one social fact as several effects.
* For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among
  `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position`:
  these are facets of the same contest, so choose the dimension that best
  names the movement rather than recording several facets of it.
* An event supports a dimension only when it meets that dimension's
  criterion, not when it merely brushes it.
* Do not collapse a real standing or belonging movement into
  `general_appraisal` to economize: a witticism that wins the room may be
  both `rhetorical_position` for the duel and `social_status` for the
  standing it visibly confers — record each on its own merits.

`delta` should reflect local movement in the passage:

Status delta:

* -2 = clearly diminished in this passage
* -1 = somewhat diminished
* 0 = do not use — if there is no clear movement, record no effect at all: null is not zero
* +1 = somewhat elevated
* +2 = clearly elevated

### `ambiguities`

Use this list to record uncertainty such as:

* ironic or layered narration
* uncertain evaluator
* ambiguous target
* uncertain reference resolution (who a surface form refers to)
* unclear endorsement by narrator or social voice

Default to an empty list.
Only add an ambiguity when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
Do not use `ambiguities` for routine caveats or general interpretive hedging.
Usually return an empty list.

### Confidence

* 0.0 to 1.0
* Be conservative when irony, layered narration, or reference resolution makes interpretation unstable.

## Important rules

* Named characters, plus only the reviewed unnamed figures on the reference sheet.
* Use the reference sheet's canonical names where a referent matches; use the
  passage's surface form verbatim with `"resolution": "unresolved"` where it
  does not. Never silently drop a materially involved character.
* `"resolution": "resolved"` may be omitted (it is the default); always state
  `"resolution": "unresolved"` explicitly.
* If a surface form is ambiguous, mention that in "ambiguities."
* Do not infer broad character arcs.
* Do not force zero-sum logic.
* A single event may affect both source and target, but record that through separate status effects if needed.
* Ignore trivial mentions that do not meaningfully alter evaluation or status.
* Do not add a winner/loser verdict field.
* Do not add a summary object.
* If there is no meaningful status movement, keep `appraisal_events` and `status_effects` empty rather than inventing a weak event.
* When narrator framing clearly guides the judgment, do not default to `neutral_report`.
* Do not turn one dominant movement into a chain of micro-events.
* Do not add balancing positive and negative effects unless both are central to the passage.
* Do not annotate every evaluatively charged phrase.
* Multiple quotations can support one event.
* If you are unsure between several event labels, pick the broadest stable one.

## Compression examples

These examples illustrate the intended first-pass compression.

Example A:

If a passage reveals that Swann is far more socially eminent than the family realizes, do **not** split this into:

* one event for narrator elevation
* one event for aristocratic association
* one event for local under-recognition

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_elevation`
* `1` main status effect: `social_status +2`

Example B:

If a passage exposes Legrandin’s evasive, socially defensive performance, do **not** split this into:

* ridicule
* humiliation
* blame
* rhetorical weakness
* emotional vulnerability

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_diminishment`
* `1` or `2` status effects at most, only if both are central

Example C:

If a passage shows Swann reaching long-desired intimacy with Odette through awkward pretext, hesitation, or dependence, do **not** reduce it to:

* one event for timidity
* one event for dependence
* one event for social compromise

Instead, prefer:

* `1` central event that preserves the realized intimacy or renewal
* a positive `emotional_position` effect when that attainment is the dominant local outcome
* a secondary note about hesitation or compromise only if it is itself central
* do **not** promote mere reunion relief unless the passage clearly crosses into intimacy or explicit renewal
* do **not** let a brief closing uplift outweigh the dominant movement of the passage unless that culminating turn is clearly the passage's main point

Example D:

If a passage shows a guest turned away at a hostess's door and then dwells
on that same refusal — the guest's confusion, the footman's repeated
message, the slow walk back down the staircase — that is **one** boundary
event:

* `1` event: `snub`
* `1` status effect: `inclusion_exclusion -2`

But if the same passage later shows the assembled room deferring to a newly
arrived title, that is a separate witnessed movement, for a different
character, grounded in its own event — record it on its own merits.

### Prior local context (optional)

Quant à la femme dont M. d’Argencourt avait été l’amant, elle n’avait pas beaucoup changé, si on tenait compte du temps passé, c’est-à-dire que son visage n’était pas trop complètement démoli pour celui d’un être qui se déforme tout le long de son trajet dans l’abîme où il est lancé, abîme dont nous ne pouvons exprimer la direction que par des comparaisons également vaines, puisque nous ne pouvons les emprunter qu’au monde de l’espace, et qui, que nous les orientions dans le sens de l’élévation, de la longueur ou de la profondeur, ont comme seul avantage de nous faire sentir que cette dimension inconcevable et sensible existe. La nécessité, pour donner un nom aux figures, de remonter effectivement le cours des années, me forçait, en réaction, de rétablir ensuite, en leur donnant leur place réelle, les années auxquelles je n’avais pensé. À ce point de vue, et pour ne pas me laisser tromper par l’identité apparente de l’espace, l’aspect tout nouveau d’un être comme M. d’Argencourt m’était une révélation frappante de cette réalité du millésime qui d’habitude nous reste abstraite, comme l’apparition de certains arbres nains ou des baobabs géants nous avertit du changement de latitude. Alors la vie nous apparaît comme la féerie où l’on voit d’acte en acte le bébé devenir adolescent, homme mûr et se courber vers la tombe. Et comme c’est par des changements perpétuels qu’on sent que ces êtres prélevés à des distances assez grandes sont si différents, on sent qu’on a suivi la même loi que ces créatures qui se sont tellement transformées qu’elles ne ressemblent plus, sans avoir cessé d’être — justement parce qu’elles n’ont pas cessé d’être — à ce que nous avons vu d’elles jadis.

### Passage

Une jeune femme que j’avais connue autrefois, maintenant blanche et tassée en petite vieille maléfique, semblait indiquer qu’il est nécessaire que, dans le divertissement final d’une pièce, les êtres fussent travestis à ne pas les reconnaître. Mais son frère était resté si droit, si pareil à lui-même qu’on s’étonnait que sur sa figure jeune il eût fait passer au blanc sa moustache bien relevée. Les parties d’une blancheur de neige de barbes jusque-là entièrement noires rendaient mélancolique le paysage humain de cette matinée, comme les premières feuilles jaunes des arbres alors qu’on croyait encore pouvoir compter sur un long été, et qu’avant d’avoir commencé d’en profiter on voit que c’est déjà l’automne. Alors moi qui, depuis mon enfance, vivais au jour le jour, ayant reçu d’ailleurs de moi-même et des autres une impression définitive, je m’aperçus pour la première fois, d’après les métamorphoses qui s’étaient produites dans tous ces gens, du temps qui avait passé pour eux, ce qui me bouleversa par la révélation qu’il avait passé aussi pour moi. Et indifférente en elle-même, leur vieillesse me désolait en m’avertissant des approches de la mienne. Celles-ci me furent, du reste, proclamées coup sur coup par des paroles qui, à quelques minutes d’intervalle, vinrent me frapper comme les trompettes du Jugement. La première fut prononcée par la duchesse de Guermantes ; je venais de la voir, passant entre une double haie de curieux qui, sans se rendre compte des merveilleux artifices de toilette et d’esthétique qui agissaient sur eux, émus devant cette tête rousse, ce corps saumoné émergeant à peine de ses ailerons de dentelle noire, et étranglé de joyaux, le regardaient, dans la sinuosité héréditaire de ses lignes, comme ils eussent fait de quelque vieux poisson sacré, chargé de pierreries, en lequel s’incarnait le Génie protecteur de la famille Guermantes. « Ah ! me dit-elle, quelle joie de vous voir, vous mon plus vieil ami. » Et, dans mon amour-propre de jeune homme de Combray qui ne m’étais jamais compté à aucun moment comme pouvant être un de ses amis, participant vraiment à la vraie vie mystérieuse qu’on menait chez les Guermantes, un de ses amis au même titre que M. de Bréauté, que M. de Forestelle, que Swann, que tous ceux qui étaient morts, j’aurais pu en être flatté, j’en étais surtout malheureux. « Son plus vieil ami ! me dis-je, elle exagère ; peut-être un des plus vieux, mais suis-je donc… » À ce moment un neveu du prince s’approcha de moi : « Vous qui êtes un vieux Parisien », me dit-il. Un instant après on me remit un mot. J’avais rencontré, en arrivant, un jeune Létourville, dont je ne savais plus très bien la parenté avec la duchesse mais qui me connaissait un peu. Il venait de sortir de Saint-Cyr, et, me disant que ce serait pour moi un gentil camarade comme avait été Saint-Loup, qui pourrait m’initier aux choses de l’armée, avec les changements qu’elle avait subis, je lui avais dit que je le retrouverais tout à l’heure et que nous prendrions rendez-vous pour dîner ensemble, ce dont il m’avait beaucoup remercié. Mais j’étais resté trop longtemps à rêver dans la bibliothèque et le petit mot qu’il avait laissé pour moi était pour me dire qu’il n’avait pu m’attendre et me laisser son adresse. La lettre de ce camarade rêvé finissait ainsi : « Avec tout le respect de votre petit ami, Létourville. » « Petit ami ! » C’est ainsi qu’autrefois j’écrivais aux gens qui avaient trente ans de plus que moi, à Legrandin par exemple. Quoi ! ce sous-lieutenant, que je me figurais mon camarade comme Saint-Loup, se disait mon petit ami. Mais alors il n’y avait donc pas que les méthodes militaires qui avaient changé depuis lors, et pour M. de Létourville j’étais donc, non un camarade, mais un vieux monsieur, et de M. de Létourville, dans la compagnie duquel je me figurais, moi, tel que je m’apparaissais à moi-même, un bon camarade, en étais-je donc séparé par l’écartement d’un invisible compas auquel je n’avais pas songé et qui me situait si loin du jeune sous-lieutenant qu’il semblait que pour celui qui se disait mon « petit ami » j’étais un vieux monsieur !

Presque aussitôt après quelqu’un parla de Bloch, je demandai si c’était du jeune homme ou du père (dont j’avais ignoré la mort, pendant la guerre, d’émotion, avait-on dit, de voir la France envahie). « Je ne savais pas qu’il eût des enfants, je ne le savais même pas marié, me dit la duchesse. Mais c’est évidemment du père que nous parlons, car il n’a rien d’un jeune homme, ajouta-t-elle en riant. Il pourrait avoir des fils qui seraient eux-mêmes déjà des hommes. » Et je compris qu’il s’agissait de mon camarade. Il entra, d’ailleurs, au bout d’un instant. J’eus de la peine à le reconnaître. D’ailleurs, il avait pris maintenant non seulement un pseudonyme, mais le nom de Jacques du Rozier, sous lequel il eût fallu le flair de mon grand’père pour reconnaître la douce vallée de l’Hébron et les chaînes d’Israël que mon ami semblait avoir définitivement rompues. Un chic anglais avait, en effet, complètement transformé sa figure et passé au rabot tout ce qui se pouvait effacer. Les cheveux, jadis bouclés, coiffés à plat avec une raie au milieu, brillaient de cosmétique. Son nez restait fort et rouge mais semblait plutôt tuméfié par une sorte de rhume permanent qui pouvait expliquer l’accent nasal dont il débitait paresseusement ses phrases, car il avait trouvé, de même qu’une coiffure appropriée à son teint, une voix à sa prononciation où le nasonnement d’autrefois prenait un air de dédain particulier qui allait avec les ailes enflammées de son nez. Et grâce à la coiffure, à la suppression des moustaches, à l’élégance du type, à la volonté, ce nez juif disparaissait comme semble presque droite une bossue bien arrangée. Mais surtout, dès que Bloch apparaissait, la signification de sa physionomie était changée par un redoutable monocle. La part de machinisme que ce monocle introduisait dans la figure de Bloch la dispensait de tous ces devoirs difficiles auxquels une figure humaine est soumise, devoir d’être belle, d’exprimer l’esprit, la bienveillance, l’effort. La seule présence de ce monocle dans la figure de Bloch dispensait d’abord de se demander si elle était jolie ou non, comme devant ces objets anglais dont un garçon dit, dans un magasin, que c’est le grand chic, après quoi on n’ose plus se demander si cela vous plaît. D’autre part, il s’installait derrière la glace de ce monocle dans une position aussi hautaine, distante et confortable que si ç’avait été la glace d’un huit ressorts, et, pour assortir la figure aux cheveux plats et au monocle, ses traits n’exprimaient plus jamais rien. Sur cette figure de Bloch je vis se superposer cette mine débile et opinante, ces frêles hochements de tête qui trouvent si vite leur cran d’arrêt, et où j’aurais reconnu la docte fatigue des vieillards aimables, si, d’autre part, je n’avais enfin reconnu devant moi mon ami et si mes souvenirs ne l’avaient animé de cet entrain juvénile et ininterrompu dont il semblait actuellement dépossédé. Pour moi qui l’avais connu au seuil de la vie, il était mon camarade, un adolescent dont je mesurais la jeunesse par celle que, n’ayant cru vivre depuis ce moment-là, je me donnais inconsciemment à moi-même. J’entendis dire qu’il paraissait bien son âge, je fus étonné de remarquer sur son visage quelques-uns de ces signes qui sont plutôt la caractéristique des hommes qui sont vieux. Je compris que c’est parce qu’il l’était en effet et que c’est avec des adolescents qui durent un assez grand nombre d’années que la vie fait ses vieillards.

Comme quelqu’un, entendant dire que j’étais souffrant, demanda si je ne craignais pas de prendre la grippe qui régnait à ce moment-là, un autre bienveillant me rassura en me disant : « Non, cela atteint plutôt les personnes encore jeunes, les gens de votre âge ne risquent plus grand’chose. » Et on assura que le personnel m’avait bien reconnu. Ils avaient chuchoté mon nom, et même « dans leur langage », raconta une dame, elle les avait entendus dire : « Voilà le Père… » (cette expression était suivie de mon nom. Et comme je n’avais pas d’enfant, elle ne pouvait se rapporter qu’à l’âge).

En attendant la duchesse de Guermantes dire : « Comment, si j’ai connu le maréchal ? Mais j’ai connu des gens bien plus représentatifs, la duchesse de Galliera, Pauline de Périgord, Mgr Dupanloup », je regrettais naïvement de ne pas avoir connu moi-même ceux qu’elle appelait un reste d’ancien régime. J’aurais dû penser qu’on appelle ancien régime ce dont on n’a pu connaître que la fin ; c’est ainsi que ce que nous apercevons à l’horizon prend une grandeur mystérieuse et nous semble se refermer sur un monde qu’on ne reverra plus ; cependant nous avançons, et c’est bientôt nous-même qui sommes à l’horizon pour les générations qui sont derrière nous ; cependant l’horizon recule, et le monde, qui semblait fini, recommence. « J’ai même pu voir, quand j’étais jeune fille, ajouta Mme de Guermantes, la duchesse de Dino. Dame, vous savez que je n’ai plus vingt-cinq ans. » Ces derniers mots me fâchèrent. Elle ne devrait pas dire cela, ce serait bon pour une vieille femme. « Quant à vous, reprit-elle, vous êtes toujours le même, vous n’avez pour ainsi dire pas changé », me dit la duchesse, et cela me fit presque plus de peine que si elle m’avait parlé d’un changement, car cela prouvait, puisqu’il était extraordinaire qu’il s’en fût si peu produit, que bien du temps s’était écoulé. « Ami, me dit-elle, vous êtes étonnant, vous restez toujours jeune », expression si mélancolique puisqu’elle n’a de sens que si nous sommes, en fait sinon d’apparence, devenus vieux. Et elle me donna le dernier coup en ajoutant : « J’ai toujours regretté que vous ne vous soyez pas marié. Au fond, qui sait, c’est peut-être plus heureux. Vous auriez été d’âge à avoir des fils à la guerre, et s’ils avaient été tués, comme l’a été ce pauvre Robert de Saint-Loup (je pense encore souvent à lui), sensible comme vous êtes, vous ne leur auriez pas survécu. » Et je pus me voir, comme dans la première glace véridique que j’eusse rencontrée dans les yeux de vieillards restés jeunes, à leur avis, comme je le croyais moi-même de moi, et qui, quand je me citais à eux, pour entendre un démenti, comme exemple de vieux, n’avaient pas dans leurs regards, qui me voyaient tel qu’ils ne se voyaient pas eux-mêmes et tel que je les voyais, une seule protestation. Car nous ne voyions pas notre propre aspect, nos propres âges, mais chacun, comme un miroir opposé, voyait celui de l’autre. Et sans doute, à découvrir qu’ils ont vieilli, bien des gens eussent été moins tristes que moi. Mais d’abord il en est de la vieillesse comme de la mort, quelques-uns les affrontent avec indifférence, non pas parce qu’ils ont plus de courage que les autres, mais parce qu’ils ont moins d’imagination. Puis un homme qui depuis son enfance vise une même idée, auquel sa paresse même et jusqu’à son état de santé, en lui faisant remettre sans cesse les réalisations, annule chaque soir le jour écoulé et perdu, si bien que la maladie qui hâte le vieillissement de son corps retarde celui de son esprit, est plus surpris et plus bouleversé de voir qu’il n’a cessé de vivre dans le Temps, que celui qui vit peu en soi-même, se règle sur le calendrier, et ne découvre pas d’un seul coup le total des années dont il a poursuivi quotidiennement l’addition. Mais une raison plus grave expliquait mon angoisse ; je découvrais cette action destructrice du Temps au moment même où je voulais entreprendre de rendre claires, d’intellectualiser dans une œuvre d’art, des réalités extra-temporelles.

Chez certains êtres le remplacement successif, mais accompli en mon absence, de chaque cellule par d’autres, avait amené un changement si complet, une si entière métamorphose que j’aurais pu dîner cent fois en face d’eux dans un restaurant sans me douter plus que je les avais connus autrefois que je n’aurais pu deviner la royauté d’un souverain incognito ou le vice d’un inconnu. La comparaison devient même insuffisante pour le cas où j’entendais leur nom, car on peut admettre qu’un inconnu assis en face de vous soit criminel ou roi, tandis qu’eux, je les avais connus, ou plutôt j’avais connu des personnes portant le même nom, mais si différentes que je ne pouvais croire que ce fussent les mêmes. Pourtant, comme j’aurais fait en partant de l’idée de souveraineté ou de vice qui ne tarde pas à donner à l’inconnu (avec qui on aurait fait si aisément, quand on avait encore les yeux bandés, la gaffe d’être insolent ou aimable), dans les mêmes traits de qui on discerne maintenant quelque chose de distingué ou de suspect, je m’appliquais à introduire dans le visage de l’inconnue, entièrement inconnue, l’idée qu’elle était Mme Sazerat, et je finissais par rétablir le sens autrefois connu de ce visage, mais qui serait resté vraiment aliéné pour moi, entièrement celui d’une autre femme ayant autant perdu tous les attributs humains que j’avais connus, qu’un homme devenu singe, si le nom et l’affirmation de l’identité ne m’avaient mis, malgré ce que le problème avait d’ardu, sur la voie de la solution. Parfois pourtant, l’ancienne image renaissait assez précise pour que je puisse essayer une confrontation ; et comme un témoin mis en présence d’un inculpé qu’il a vu, j’étais forcé, tant la différence était grande, de dire : « Non… je ne le reconnais pas. »
