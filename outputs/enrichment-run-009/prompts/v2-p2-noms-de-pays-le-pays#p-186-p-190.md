You are annotating a French passage from Marcel Proust's *À la recherche du temps perdu* for **local appraisal events** and **character status effects**.

Your purpose is to generate structured literary-social annotations that can later be transformed into different notions of "winning" and "losing."
Do **not** reduce the passage to a single winner-loser verdict unless the evidence is overwhelmingly explicit.
Instead, identify the **dominant local evaluative acts** and their consequences for the named characters.

## Inputs

You will be given:

1. A French passage. The text is Proust's original, unaltered.
2. A **reference sheet** of known characters and their surface forms for this
   chapter, including a small reviewed set of individuated unnamed figures
   (e.g. l'amie de Mlle Vinteuil) and resolution notes for family references
   ("ma grand'mère", "maman").
3. Optionally, brief prior context from the immediately preceding window.

## Scope rules

* The reference sheet is **advisory context, not a constraint on who exists**.
  When a referent in the passage matches an entry, use that entry's canonical
  name.
* List **every named character materially involved** in the passage's
  evaluative or social dynamics — including characters **not** on the
  reference sheet. For those, use the passage's surface form verbatim as
  `canonical_name` and add `"resolution": "unresolved"` to their
  `characters_present` entry.
* Unnamed figures are included only when they appear on the reference sheet
  as reviewed entries; do not invent descriptor-identified characters beyond
  the sheet.
* Work primarily from the passage itself.
* Use prior context only for local disambiguation of references, not for broad plot inference.
* Do not invent motives, unstated events, or long-run arc interpretations.
* Prefer the **smallest sufficient reading** of the passage.

## What to detect

Track local shifts in how named characters are positioned through:

* praise
* blame
* admiration
* snub
* prestige by association
* discredit by association
* narrated elevation or diminishment
* inclusion in or exclusion from valued social space
* signs that another character depends on, yields to, or dismisses them

For this first pass, prefer **broad, stable categories** over fine-grained distinctions.
Do not split one local movement into multiple event labels unless the passage clearly stages them as distinct.

## Interpretive principles

A character may come out ahead or behind in several ways:

* directly, by being praised or insulted
* comparatively, by being favored over another
* socially, by being included, deferred to, or excluded
* rhetorically, by speaking with force, wit, authority, or discernment
* emotionally, by gaining leverage over another character
* associationally, by benefiting from or suffering through a linked person
* narratively, through a passage that appears to elevate or diminish them

Do **not** judge:

* morality
* factual correctness
* long-term importance
* whether the character "deserves" the treatment

Judge only the **local evaluative and social dynamics** of the supplied passage.

## Special caution for Proust

Proust often layers evaluation through:

* quoted speech
* free indirect style
* remembered perception
* irony
* narrator distance
* social codes that are reported rather than endorsed

For every evaluative event, distinguish:

* who is making the evaluation
* who is its target
* whether the passage appears to endorse, neutrally report, ironize, or leave uncertain that evaluation

## Special rule for consummation and renewal

In erotic or affective passages, distinguish between:

* the mode of attainment
* the attained local outcome

Timidity, dependence, awkwardness, compromise, or ironic framing may qualify how an outcome is reached, but they do **not** by themselves override a plainly successful local outcome.

If the passage culminates in any of the following, that dominant positive movement must be represented in the annotation:

* realized intimacy
* mutual receptivity
* successful consummation
* narrator-endorsed emotional renewal

Do **not** collapse such passages into pure diminishment merely because the path to that outcome is hesitant, dependent, socially compromising, or lightly ironized.
When both weakness and successful renewal coexist, preserve the dominant local success and mention the qualifying weakness only if it is central.
Do **not** treat mere reunion, temporary relief, or the end of uncertainty as equivalent to consummation or renewal.
Relief at finding the desired person again counts as dominant positive movement only if the passage itself goes on to show realized intimacy, mutual receptivity, or an explicitly narrator-endorsed affective transformation.
Weigh the passage as a whole rather than over-privileging its final sentence or final image.
Do **not** let a single upbeat note, however striking or late-placed, outweigh a passage whose dominant body is organized around anxious search, dependency, agitation, jealousy, or diminishment unless the passage is plainly structured so that the culmination redefines the whole local movement.
If most of the passage is governed by distress and only a brief closing note offers relief, prefer a mixed or negative reading unless the text clearly presents that closing turn as the main narrated point.

## Task

1. Identify only the named characters who are materially involved in the dominant local movement.
2. Extract only the **significant** appraisal or status-relevant events.
3. Record only the dominant local status effects for the characters involved.
4. Note ambiguity only when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
5. Multiple characters may gain or lose simultaneously.
6. If there is no meaningful status movement, return empty `appraisal_events` and empty `status_effects`.
7. Prefer fewer, high-quality events over many trivial ones.
8. Default to **1 main event** for a passage.
9. Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct, non-redundant local movements.
10. A dense social scene — several characters, several separately witnessed movements — may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct movement that the others do not cover. Never return more than **4 appraisal events**.
11. Do not add balancing or countervailing events unless they are central to the passage.
12. For one character: at most **one status effect per dimension**. A second effect in the same dimension is allowed only for clearly separate moments of the passage, each citing different `based_on_events`.
13. For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position` — these are facets of the same contest; choose the dimension that best names the movement. The same event may additionally ground a `social_status` or `inclusion_exclusion` effect for that character when that dimension's own criterion is independently met.

## Schema guidance

Use a reduced first-pass schema.

Do not add fields beyond the schema above.

### `characters_present`

Include only named characters who are either:

* explicitly mentioned in the passage
* clearly implicated by nearby reference in the passage or optional prior context

Do **not** include every discourse participant.
Include a character only if omitting them would distort the dominant local appraisal or status movement.
Peripheral parents, relatives, or bystanders should usually be omitted in this first pass.

### `appraisal_events`

Record only significant local evaluative or status-relevant events.

Prefer fewer, stronger events over exhaustive tagging.
Default to **1 event**.
Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct movements that are both central.
A dense social scene may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct
witnessed movement that the others do not cover — a salon may snub one guest,
crown another, and watch a third fall in the same evening. This is not license
to fragment: every "bad reason to create an event" below still applies, and an
event that merely restates or elaborates another must not be added.
Never emit more than **4 events** total.

Good reasons to create an event:

* one character is praised, admired, deferred to, or favored
* one character is blamed, ridiculed, excluded, snubbed, or diminished
* a comparison clearly puts one character above or below another
* a character gains or loses rhetorical or emotional leverage
* association with another figure clearly raises or lowers local standing

Bad reasons to create a separate event:

* a subordinate nuance merely restates the same local movement
* a quoted phrase provides color but not a distinct appraisal act
* a possible counter-reading is present but not central
* a nearby character is involved in the scene but not in the main evaluative movement
* one sentence offers several pieces of evidence for the same local movement
* the same movement could be described with several nearby labels

Prefer these broad labels when possible:

* `narrated_diminishment`
* `narrated_elevation`
* `snub`
* `admiration`
* `blame`
* `prestige_association`
* `discredit_association`

Avoid finer-grained labels unless the passage truly demands them.
Choose the **single best label** for the dominant movement rather than enumerating nearby alternatives.

### `status_effects`

Use these dimensions only. Each is governed by its own criterion:

* `general_appraisal` — the passage's evaluative verdict on a character:
  praised, admired, ridiculed, or discredited in the narration or the scene.
* `rhetorical_position` — the upper hand in talk: wit that lands or misfires,
  an argument won or lost, a line that silences or is silenced.
* `emotional_position` — emotional leverage in a relation: who needs, who
  withholds, who suffers visibly, who controls.
* `social_status` — a movement or display of standing that is **witnessed
  inside the world of the passage**. Someone present — or society's reported
  voice — must register it: deference given or withheld, a reception or
  invitation that marks rank, a public snub, a reputation spoken of as risen
  or fallen. A private, unshared judgment of a character is
  `general_appraisal`, not `social_status`.
* `inclusion_exclusion` — a **boundary event**: an interior with an
  exterior, and a character shown crossing that line or barred at it —
  introduced or not introduced, greeted or cut, invited or left out, absorbed
  into the group or held at its edge. The boundary need not belong to a
  social set: the family table, a household, a bedroom door, a clan, a club,
  a box at the theatre, the circle of a conversation, the intimacy of
  tutoiement, an institution, a nation, a clandestine fraternity — all count,
  so long as the passage shows an inside, an outside, and this character's
  position across that line changing. Mere
  presence at a gathering is not inclusion, and absence is not exclusion;
  the boundary itself must be shown moving for this character.

Create status effects only when there is meaningful local movement.
Record **every distinct movement that meets its dimension's criterion**.
Most characters will still have 1 status effect, some 2; a dense social
scene may genuinely support more. There is no fixed cap, but distinctness
is strict:

* Two effects in the **same dimension** for one character are allowed only
  when they arise from clearly separate moments of the passage — different
  events, different witnesses, a different boundary — and could not honestly
  be summarized as one movement. Each must cite different `based_on_events`.
  When in doubt, summarize as one.
* Never restate one social fact as several effects.
* For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among
  `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position`:
  these are facets of the same contest, so choose the dimension that best
  names the movement rather than recording several facets of it.
* An event supports a dimension only when it meets that dimension's
  criterion, not when it merely brushes it.
* Do not collapse a real standing or belonging movement into
  `general_appraisal` to economize: a witticism that wins the room may be
  both `rhetorical_position` for the duel and `social_status` for the
  standing it visibly confers — record each on its own merits.

`delta` should reflect local movement in the passage:

Status delta:

* -2 = clearly diminished in this passage
* -1 = somewhat diminished
* 0 = do not use — if there is no clear movement, record no effect at all: null is not zero
* +1 = somewhat elevated
* +2 = clearly elevated

### `ambiguities`

Use this list to record uncertainty such as:

* ironic or layered narration
* uncertain evaluator
* ambiguous target
* uncertain reference resolution (who a surface form refers to)
* unclear endorsement by narrator or social voice

Default to an empty list.
Only add an ambiguity when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
Do not use `ambiguities` for routine caveats or general interpretive hedging.
Usually return an empty list.

### Confidence

* 0.0 to 1.0
* Be conservative when irony, layered narration, or reference resolution makes interpretation unstable.

## Important rules

* Named characters, plus only the reviewed unnamed figures on the reference sheet.
* Use the reference sheet's canonical names where a referent matches; use the
  passage's surface form verbatim with `"resolution": "unresolved"` where it
  does not. Never silently drop a materially involved character.
* `"resolution": "resolved"` may be omitted (it is the default); always state
  `"resolution": "unresolved"` explicitly.
* If a surface form is ambiguous, mention that in "ambiguities."
* Do not infer broad character arcs.
* Do not force zero-sum logic.
* A single event may affect both source and target, but record that through separate status effects if needed.
* Ignore trivial mentions that do not meaningfully alter evaluation or status.
* Do not add a winner/loser verdict field.
* Do not add a summary object.
* If there is no meaningful status movement, keep `appraisal_events` and `status_effects` empty rather than inventing a weak event.
* When narrator framing clearly guides the judgment, do not default to `neutral_report`.
* Do not turn one dominant movement into a chain of micro-events.
* Do not add balancing positive and negative effects unless both are central to the passage.
* Do not annotate every evaluatively charged phrase.
* Multiple quotations can support one event.
* If you are unsure between several event labels, pick the broadest stable one.

## Compression examples

These examples illustrate the intended first-pass compression.

Example A:

If a passage reveals that Swann is far more socially eminent than the family realizes, do **not** split this into:

* one event for narrator elevation
* one event for aristocratic association
* one event for local under-recognition

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_elevation`
* `1` main status effect: `social_status +2`

Example B:

If a passage exposes Legrandin’s evasive, socially defensive performance, do **not** split this into:

* ridicule
* humiliation
* blame
* rhetorical weakness
* emotional vulnerability

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_diminishment`
* `1` or `2` status effects at most, only if both are central

Example C:

If a passage shows Swann reaching long-desired intimacy with Odette through awkward pretext, hesitation, or dependence, do **not** reduce it to:

* one event for timidity
* one event for dependence
* one event for social compromise

Instead, prefer:

* `1` central event that preserves the realized intimacy or renewal
* a positive `emotional_position` effect when that attainment is the dominant local outcome
* a secondary note about hesitation or compromise only if it is itself central
* do **not** promote mere reunion relief unless the passage clearly crosses into intimacy or explicit renewal
* do **not** let a brief closing uplift outweigh the dominant movement of the passage unless that culminating turn is clearly the passage's main point

Example D:

If a passage shows a guest turned away at a hostess's door and then dwells
on that same refusal — the guest's confusion, the footman's repeated
message, the slow walk back down the staircase — that is **one** boundary
event:

* `1` event: `snub`
* `1` status effect: `inclusion_exclusion -2`

But if the same passage later shows the assembled room deferring to a newly
arrived title, that is a separate witnessed movement, for a different
character, grounded in its own event — record it on its own merits.

### Prior local context (optional)

Puis Bloch me dit des choses fort gentilles. Il avait certainement envie d’être très aimable avec moi. Pourtant, il me demanda : « Est-ce par goût de t’élever vers la noblesse — une noblesse très à-côté du reste, mais tu es demeuré naïf — que tu fréquentes de Saint-Loup-en-Bray ? Tu dois être en train de traverser une jolie crise de snobisme. Dis-moi, es-tu snob ? Oui, n’est-ce pas ? » Ce n’est pas que son désir d’amabilité eût brusquement changé. Mais ce qu’on appelle en un français assez incorrect « la mauvaise éducation » était son défaut, par conséquent le défaut dont il ne s’apercevait pas, à plus forte raison dont il ne crût pas que les autres pussent être choqués. Dans l’humanité, la fréquence des vertus identiques pour tous n’est pas plus merveilleuse que la multiplicité des défauts particuliers à chacun. Sans doute ce n’est pas le bon sens qui est « la chose du monde la plus répandue », c’est la bonté. Dans les coins les plus lointains, les plus perdus, on s’émerveille de la voir fleurir d’elle-même, comme dans un vallon écarté un coquelicot pareil à ceux du reste du monde, lui qui ne les a jamais vus, et n’a jamais connu que le vent qui fait frissonner parfois son rouge chaperon solitaire. Même si cette bonté, paralysée par l’intérêt, ne s’exerce pas, elle existe pourtant, et chaque fois qu’aucun mobile égoïste ne l’empêche de le faire, par exemple pendant la lecture d’un roman ou d’un journal, elle s’épanouit, se tourne, même dans le cœur de celui qui, assassin dans la vie, reste tendre comme amateur de feuilletons, vers le faible, vers le juste et le persécuté. Mais la variété des défauts n’est pas moins admirable que la similitude des vertus. Chacun a tellement les siens que pour continuer à l’aimer, nous sommes obligés de n’en pas tenir compte et de les négliger en faveur du reste. La personne la plus parfaite a un certain défaut qui choque ou qui met en rage. L’une est d’une belle intelligence, voit tout d’un point de vue élevé, ne dit jamais de mal de personne, mais oublie dans sa poche les lettres les plus importantes qu’elle vous a demandé elle-même de lui confier, et vous fait manquer ensuite un rendez-vous capital, sans vous faire d’excuses, avec un sourire, parce qu’elle met sa fierté à ne jamais savoir l’heure. Un autre a tant de finesse, de douceur, de procédés délicats, qu’il ne vous dit jamais de vous-même que les choses qui peuvent vous rendre heureux, mais vous sentez qu’il en tait, qu’il en ensevelit dans son cœur, où elles aigrissent, de toutes différentes, et le plaisir qu’il a à vous voir lui est si cher qu’il vous ferait crever de fatigue plutôt que de vous quitter. Un troisième a plus de sincérité, mais la pousse jusqu’à tenir à ce que vous sachiez, quand vous vous êtes excusé sur votre état de santé de ne pas être allé le voir, que vous avez été vu vous rendant au théâtre et qu’on vous a trouvé bonne mine, ou qu’il n’a pu profiter entièrement de la démarche que vous avez faite pour lui, que d’ailleurs déjà trois autres lui ont proposé de faire et dont il ne vous est ainsi que légèrement obligé. Dans les deux circonstances, l’ami précédent aurait fait semblant d’ignorer que vous étiez allé au théâtre et que d’autres personnes eussent pu lui rendre le même service. Quant à ce dernier ami, il éprouve le besoin de répéter ou de révéler à quelqu’un ce qui peut le plus vous contrarier, est ravi de sa franchise et vous dit avec force : « Je suis comme cela. » Tandis que d’autres vous agacent par leur curiosité exagérée, ou par leur incuriosité si absolue, que vous pouvez leur parler des événements les plus sensationnels sans qu’ils sachent de quoi il s’agit ; que d’autres encore restent des mois à vous répondre si votre lettre a trait à un fait qui concerne vous et non eux, ou bien s’ils vous disent qu’ils vont venir vous demander quelque chose et que vous n’osiez pas sortir de peur de les manquer, ne viennent pas et vous laissent attendre des semaines parce que n’ayant pas reçu de vous la réponse que leur lettre ne demandait nullement, ils avaient cru vous avoir fâché. Et certains, consultant leur désir et non le vôtre, vous parlent sans vous laisser placer un mot s’ils sont gais et ont envie de vous voir, quelque travail urgent que vous ayez à faire, mais s’ils se sentent fatigués par le temps, ou de mauvaise humeur, vous ne pouvez tirer d’eux une parole, ils opposent à vos efforts une inerte langueur et ne prennent pas plus la peine de répondre, même par monosyllabes, à ce que vous dites que s’ils ne vous avaient pas entendus. Chacun de nos amis a tellement ses défauts que pour continuer à l’aimer nous sommes obligés d’essayer de nous consoler d’eux — en pensant à son talent, à sa bonté, à sa tendresse — ou plutôt de ne pas en tenir compte en déployant pour cela toute notre bonne volonté. Malheureusement notre complaisante obstination à ne pas voir le défaut de notre ami est surpassée par celle qu’il met à s’y adonner à cause de son aveuglement ou de celui qu’il prête aux autres. Car il ne le voit pas ou croit qu’on ne le voit pas. Comme le risque de déplaire vient surtout de la difficulté d’apprécier ce qui passe ou non inaperçu, on devrait, au moins, par prudence, ne jamais parler de soi, parce que c’est un sujet où on peut être sûr que la vue des autres et la nôtre propre ne concordent jamais. Si on a autant de surprises qu’à visiter une maison d’apparence quelconque dont l’intérieur est rempli de trésors, de pinces-monseigneur et de cadavres quand on découvre la vraie vie des autres, l’univers réel sous l’univers apparent, on n’en éprouve pas moins si, au lieu de l’image qu’on s’était faite de soi-même grâce à ce que chacun nous en disait, on apprend par le langage qu’ils tiennent à notre égard en notre absence quelle image entièrement différente ils portaient en eux de notre vie. De sorte que chaque fois que nous avons parlé de nous, nous pouvons être sûrs que nos inoffensives et prudentes paroles, écoutées avec une politesse apparente et une hypocrite approbation, ont donné lieu aux commentaires les plus exaspérés ou les plus joyeux, en tous cas les moins favorables. Le moins que nous risquions est d’agacer par la disproportion qu’il y a entre notre idée de nous-même et nos paroles, disproportion qui rend généralement les propos des gens sur eux aussi risibles que ces chantonnements des faux amateurs de musique qui éprouvent le besoin de fredonner un air qu’ils aiment en compensant l’insuffisance de leur murmure inarticulé par une mimique énergique et un air d’admiration que ce qu’ils nous font entendre ne justifie pas. Et à la mauvaise habitude de parler de soi et de ses défauts il faut ajouter, comme faisant bloc avec elle, cette autre de dénoncer chez les autres des défauts précisément analogues à ceux qu’on a. Or, c’est toujours de ces défauts-là qu’on parle, comme si c’était une manière de parler de soi détournée, et qui joint au plaisir de s’absoudre celui d’avouer. D’ailleurs il semble que notre attention toujours attirée sur ce qui nous caractérise le remarque plus que toute autre chose chez les autres. Un myope dit d’un autre : « Mais il peut à peine ouvrir les yeux » ; un poitrinaire a des doutes sur l’intégrité pulmonaire du plus solide ; un malpropre ne parle que des bains que les autres ne prennent pas ; un malodorant prétend qu’on sent mauvais ; un mari trompé voit partout des maris trompés ; une femme légère des femmes légères ; le snob des snobs. Et puis chaque vice, comme chaque profession, exige et développe un savoir spécial qu’on n’est pas fâché d’étaler. L’inverti dépiste les invertis, le couturier invité dans le monde n’a pas encore causé avec vous qu’il a déjà apprécié l’étoffe de votre vêtement et que ses doigts brûlent d’en palper les qualités, et si après quelques instants de conversation vous demandiez sa vraie opinion sur vous à un odontalgiste, il vous dirait le nombre de vos mauvaises dents. Rien ne lui apparaît plus important, et à vous, qui avez remarqué les siennes, plus ridicule. Et ce n’est pas seulement quand nous parlons de nous que nous croyons les autres aveugles ; nous agissons comme s’ils l’étaient. Pour chacun de nous, un Dieu spécial est là qui lui cache ou lui promet l’invisibilité de son défaut, de même qu’il ferme les yeux et les narines aux gens qui ne se lavent pas, sur la raie de crasse qu’ils portent aux oreilles et l’odeur de transpiration qu’ils gardent au creux des bras, et les persuade qu’ils peuvent impunément promener l’une et l’autre dans le monde qui ne s’apercevra de rien. Et ceux qui portent ou donnent en présent de fausses perles s’imaginent qu’on les prendra pour des vraies. Bloch était mal élevé, névropathe, snob, et, appartenant à une famille peu estimée, supportait comme au fond des mers les incalculables pressions que faisaient peser sur lui, non seulement les chrétiens de la surface, mais les couches superposées des castes juives supérieures à la sienne, chacune accablant de son mépris celle qui lui était immédiatement inférieure. Percer jusqu’à l’air libre en s’élevant de famille juive en famille juive eût demandé à Bloch plusieurs milliers d’années. Il valait mieux chercher à se frayer une issue d’un autre côté.

### Passage

Quand Bloch me parla de la crise de snobisme que je devais traverser et me demanda de lui avouer que j’étais snob, j’aurais pu lui répondre : « Si je l’étais, je ne te fréquenterais pas. » Je lui dis seulement qu’il était peu aimable. Alors il voulut s’excuser mais selon le mode qui est justement celui de l’homme mal élevé, lequel est trop heureux en revenant sur ses paroles de trouver une occasion de les aggraver. « Pardonne-moi, me disait-il maintenant chaque fois qu’il me rencontrait, je t’ai chagriné, torturé, j’ai été méchant à plaisir. Et pourtant — l’homme en général et ton ami en particulier est un si singulier animal — tu ne peux imaginer, moi qui te taquine si cruellement, la tendresse que j’ai pour toi. Elle va souvent, quand je pense à toi, jusqu’aux larmes. » Et il fit entendre un sanglot.

Ce qui m’étonnait plus chez Bloch que ses mauvaises manières, c’était combien la qualité de sa conversation était inégale. Ce garçon si difficile, qui des écrivains les plus en vogue disait : « C’est un sombre idiot, c’est tout à fait un imbécile », par moments racontait avec une grande gaieté des anecdotes qui n’avaient rien de drôle et citait comme « quelqu’un de vraiment curieux » tel homme entièrement médiocre. Cette double balance pour juger de l’esprit, de la valeur, de l’intérêt des êtres, ne laissa pas de m’étonner jusqu’au jour où je connus M. Bloch père.

Je n’avais pas cru que nous serions jamais admis à le connaître, car Bloch fils avait mal parlé de moi à Saint-Loup et de Saint-Loup à moi. Il avait notamment dit à Robert que j’étais (toujours) affreusement snob. « Si, si, il est enchanté de connaître M. LLLLegrandin », dit-il. Cette manière de détacher un mot était chez Bloch le signe à la fois de l’ironie et de la littérature. Saint-Loup qui n’avait jamais entendu le nom de Legrandin s’étonna : « Mais qui est-ce ? — Oh ! c’est quelqu’un de très bien », répondit Bloch en riant et en mettant frileusement ses mains dans les poches de son veston, persuadé qu’il était en ce moment en train de contempler le pittoresque aspect d’un extraordinaire gentilhomme provincial auprès de quoi ceux de Barbey d’Aurevilly n’étaient rien. Il se consolait de ne pas savoir peindre M. Legrandin en lui donnant plusieurs L et en savourant ce nom comme un vin de derrière les fagots. Mais ces jouissances subjectives restaient inconnues aux autres. S’il dit à Saint-Loup du mal de moi, d’autre part il ne m’en dit pas moins de Saint-Loup. Nous avions connu le détail de ces médisances chacun dès le lendemain, non que nous nous les fussions répétées l’un à l’autre, ce qui nous eût semblé très coupable, mais paraissait si naturel et presque si inévitable à Bloch que dans son inquiétude, et tenant pour certain qu’il ne ferait qu’apprendre à l’un ou à l’autre ce qu’ils allaient savoir, il préféra prendre les devants, et emmenant Saint-Loup à part lui avoua qu’il avait dit du mal de lui, exprès, pour que cela lui fût redit, lui jura « par le Kronion Zeus, gardien des serments », qu’il l’aimait, qu’il donnerait sa vie pour lui et essuya une larme. Le même jour, il s’arrangea pour me voir seul, me fit sa confession, déclara qu’il avait agi dans mon intérêt parce qu’il croyait qu’un certain genre de relations mondaines m’était néfaste et que je « valais mieux que cela ». Puis, me prenant la main avec un attendrissement d’ivrogne, bien que son ivresse fût purement nerveuse : « Crois-moi, dit-il, et que la noire Ker me saisisse à l’instant et me fasse franchir les portes d’Hadès, odieux aux hommes, si hier en pensant à toi, à Combray, à ma tendresse infinie pour toi, à telles après-midi en classe que tu ne te rappelles même pas, je n’ai pas sangloté toute la nuit. Oui, toute la nuit, je te le jure, et hélas, je le sais, car je connais les âmes, tu ne me croiras pas. » Je ne le croyais pas, en effet, et à ces paroles que je sentais inventées à l’instant même et au fur et à mesure qu’il parlait, son serment « par la Ker » n’ajoutait pas un grand poids, le culte hellénique étant chez Bloch purement littéraire. D’ailleurs dès qu’il commençait à s’attendrir et désirait qu’on s’attendrît sur un fait faux, il disait : « Je te le jure », plus encore pour la volupté hystérique de mentir que dans l’intérêt de faire croire qu’il disait la vérité. Je ne croyais pas ce qu’il me disait, mais je ne lui en voulais pas, car je tenais de ma mère et de ma grand’mère d’être incapable de rancune, même contre de bien plus grands coupables, et de ne jamais condamner personne.

Ce n’était du reste pas absolument un mauvais garçon que Bloch, il pouvait avoir de grandes gentillesses. Et depuis que la race de Combray, la race d’où sortaient des êtres absolument intacts comme ma grand’mère et ma mère, semble presque éteinte, comme je n’ai plus guère le choix qu’entre d’honnêtes brutes, insensibles et loyales et chez qui le simple son de la voix montre bien vite qu’ils ne se soucient en rien de votre vie — et une autre espèce d’hommes qui tant qu’ils sont auprès de vous vous comprennent, vous chérissent, s’attendrissent jusqu’à pleurer, prennent leur revanche quelques heures plus tard en faisant une cruelle plaisanterie sur vous, mais vous reviennent, toujours aussi compréhensifs, aussi charmants, aussi momentanément assimilés à vous-même, je crois que c’est cette dernière sorte d’hommes dont je préfère, sinon la valeur morale, du moins la société.

— Tu ne peux t’imaginer ma douleur quand je pense à toi, reprit Bloch. Au fond, c’est un côté assez juif chez moi, ajouta-t-il ironiquement en rétrécissant sa prunelle comme s’il s’agissait de doser au microscope une quantité infinitésimale de « sang juif » et comme aurait pu le dire — mais ne l’eût pas dit — un grand seigneur français qui parmi ses ancêtres tous chrétiens eût pourtant compté Samuel Bernard ou plus anciennement encore la Sainte Vierge de qui prétendent descendre, dit-on, les Lévy — qui reparaît : « J’aime assez, ajouta-t-il, faire ainsi dans mes sentiments la part, assez mince d’ailleurs, qui peut tenir à mes origines juives ». Il prononça cette phrase parce que cela lui paraissait à la fois spirituel et brave de dire la vérité sur sa race, vérité que par la même occasion il s’arrangeait à atténuer singulièrement, comme les avares qui se décident à acquitter leurs dettes mais n’ont le courage d’en payer que la moitié. Ce genre de fraudes qui consiste à avoir l’audace de proclamer la vérité, mais en y mêlant, pour une bonne part, des mensonges qui la falsifient, est plus répandu qu’on ne pense et même, chez ceux qui ne le pratiquent pas habituellement, certaines crises dans la vie, notamment celles où une liaison amoureuse est en jeu, leur donnent l’occasion de s’y livrer.
