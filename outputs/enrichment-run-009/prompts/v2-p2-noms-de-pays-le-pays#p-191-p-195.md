You are annotating a French passage from Marcel Proust's *À la recherche du temps perdu* for **local appraisal events** and **character status effects**.

Your purpose is to generate structured literary-social annotations that can later be transformed into different notions of "winning" and "losing."
Do **not** reduce the passage to a single winner-loser verdict unless the evidence is overwhelmingly explicit.
Instead, identify the **dominant local evaluative acts** and their consequences for the named characters.

## Inputs

You will be given:

1. A French passage. The text is Proust's original, unaltered.
2. A **reference sheet** of known characters and their surface forms for this
   chapter, including a small reviewed set of individuated unnamed figures
   (e.g. l'amie de Mlle Vinteuil) and resolution notes for family references
   ("ma grand'mère", "maman").
3. Optionally, brief prior context from the immediately preceding window.

## Scope rules

* The reference sheet is **advisory context, not a constraint on who exists**.
  When a referent in the passage matches an entry, use that entry's canonical
  name.
* List **every named character materially involved** in the passage's
  evaluative or social dynamics — including characters **not** on the
  reference sheet. For those, use the passage's surface form verbatim as
  `canonical_name` and add `"resolution": "unresolved"` to their
  `characters_present` entry.
* Unnamed figures are included only when they appear on the reference sheet
  as reviewed entries; do not invent descriptor-identified characters beyond
  the sheet.
* Work primarily from the passage itself.
* Use prior context only for local disambiguation of references, not for broad plot inference.
* Do not invent motives, unstated events, or long-run arc interpretations.
* Prefer the **smallest sufficient reading** of the passage.

## What to detect

Track local shifts in how named characters are positioned through:

* praise
* blame
* admiration
* snub
* prestige by association
* discredit by association
* narrated elevation or diminishment
* inclusion in or exclusion from valued social space
* signs that another character depends on, yields to, or dismisses them

For this first pass, prefer **broad, stable categories** over fine-grained distinctions.
Do not split one local movement into multiple event labels unless the passage clearly stages them as distinct.

## Interpretive principles

A character may come out ahead or behind in several ways:

* directly, by being praised or insulted
* comparatively, by being favored over another
* socially, by being included, deferred to, or excluded
* rhetorically, by speaking with force, wit, authority, or discernment
* emotionally, by gaining leverage over another character
* associationally, by benefiting from or suffering through a linked person
* narratively, through a passage that appears to elevate or diminish them

Do **not** judge:

* morality
* factual correctness
* long-term importance
* whether the character "deserves" the treatment

Judge only the **local evaluative and social dynamics** of the supplied passage.

## Special caution for Proust

Proust often layers evaluation through:

* quoted speech
* free indirect style
* remembered perception
* irony
* narrator distance
* social codes that are reported rather than endorsed

For every evaluative event, distinguish:

* who is making the evaluation
* who is its target
* whether the passage appears to endorse, neutrally report, ironize, or leave uncertain that evaluation

## Special rule for consummation and renewal

In erotic or affective passages, distinguish between:

* the mode of attainment
* the attained local outcome

Timidity, dependence, awkwardness, compromise, or ironic framing may qualify how an outcome is reached, but they do **not** by themselves override a plainly successful local outcome.

If the passage culminates in any of the following, that dominant positive movement must be represented in the annotation:

* realized intimacy
* mutual receptivity
* successful consummation
* narrator-endorsed emotional renewal

Do **not** collapse such passages into pure diminishment merely because the path to that outcome is hesitant, dependent, socially compromising, or lightly ironized.
When both weakness and successful renewal coexist, preserve the dominant local success and mention the qualifying weakness only if it is central.
Do **not** treat mere reunion, temporary relief, or the end of uncertainty as equivalent to consummation or renewal.
Relief at finding the desired person again counts as dominant positive movement only if the passage itself goes on to show realized intimacy, mutual receptivity, or an explicitly narrator-endorsed affective transformation.
Weigh the passage as a whole rather than over-privileging its final sentence or final image.
Do **not** let a single upbeat note, however striking or late-placed, outweigh a passage whose dominant body is organized around anxious search, dependency, agitation, jealousy, or diminishment unless the passage is plainly structured so that the culmination redefines the whole local movement.
If most of the passage is governed by distress and only a brief closing note offers relief, prefer a mixed or negative reading unless the text clearly presents that closing turn as the main narrated point.

## Task

1. Identify only the named characters who are materially involved in the dominant local movement.
2. Extract only the **significant** appraisal or status-relevant events.
3. Record only the dominant local status effects for the characters involved.
4. Note ambiguity only when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
5. Multiple characters may gain or lose simultaneously.
6. If there is no meaningful status movement, return empty `appraisal_events` and empty `status_effects`.
7. Prefer fewer, high-quality events over many trivial ones.
8. Default to **1 main event** for a passage.
9. Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct, non-redundant local movements.
10. A dense social scene — several characters, several separately witnessed movements — may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct movement that the others do not cover. Never return more than **4 appraisal events**.
11. Do not add balancing or countervailing events unless they are central to the passage.
12. For one character: at most **one status effect per dimension**. A second effect in the same dimension is allowed only for clearly separate moments of the passage, each citing different `based_on_events`.
13. For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position` — these are facets of the same contest; choose the dimension that best names the movement. The same event may additionally ground a `social_status` or `inclusion_exclusion` effect for that character when that dimension's own criterion is independently met.

## Schema guidance

Use a reduced first-pass schema.

Do not add fields beyond the schema above.

### `characters_present`

Include only named characters who are either:

* explicitly mentioned in the passage
* clearly implicated by nearby reference in the passage or optional prior context

Do **not** include every discourse participant.
Include a character only if omitting them would distort the dominant local appraisal or status movement.
Peripheral parents, relatives, or bystanders should usually be omitted in this first pass.

### `appraisal_events`

Record only significant local evaluative or status-relevant events.

Prefer fewer, stronger events over exhaustive tagging.
Default to **1 event**.
Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct movements that are both central.
A dense social scene may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct
witnessed movement that the others do not cover — a salon may snub one guest,
crown another, and watch a third fall in the same evening. This is not license
to fragment: every "bad reason to create an event" below still applies, and an
event that merely restates or elaborates another must not be added.
Never emit more than **4 events** total.

Good reasons to create an event:

* one character is praised, admired, deferred to, or favored
* one character is blamed, ridiculed, excluded, snubbed, or diminished
* a comparison clearly puts one character above or below another
* a character gains or loses rhetorical or emotional leverage
* association with another figure clearly raises or lowers local standing

Bad reasons to create a separate event:

* a subordinate nuance merely restates the same local movement
* a quoted phrase provides color but not a distinct appraisal act
* a possible counter-reading is present but not central
* a nearby character is involved in the scene but not in the main evaluative movement
* one sentence offers several pieces of evidence for the same local movement
* the same movement could be described with several nearby labels

Prefer these broad labels when possible:

* `narrated_diminishment`
* `narrated_elevation`
* `snub`
* `admiration`
* `blame`
* `prestige_association`
* `discredit_association`

Avoid finer-grained labels unless the passage truly demands them.
Choose the **single best label** for the dominant movement rather than enumerating nearby alternatives.

### `status_effects`

Use these dimensions only. Each is governed by its own criterion:

* `general_appraisal` — the passage's evaluative verdict on a character:
  praised, admired, ridiculed, or discredited in the narration or the scene.
* `rhetorical_position` — the upper hand in talk: wit that lands or misfires,
  an argument won or lost, a line that silences or is silenced.
* `emotional_position` — emotional leverage in a relation: who needs, who
  withholds, who suffers visibly, who controls.
* `social_status` — a movement or display of standing that is **witnessed
  inside the world of the passage**. Someone present — or society's reported
  voice — must register it: deference given or withheld, a reception or
  invitation that marks rank, a public snub, a reputation spoken of as risen
  or fallen. A private, unshared judgment of a character is
  `general_appraisal`, not `social_status`.
* `inclusion_exclusion` — a **boundary event**: an interior with an
  exterior, and a character shown crossing that line or barred at it —
  introduced or not introduced, greeted or cut, invited or left out, absorbed
  into the group or held at its edge. The boundary need not belong to a
  social set: the family table, a household, a bedroom door, a clan, a club,
  a box at the theatre, the circle of a conversation, the intimacy of
  tutoiement, an institution, a nation, a clandestine fraternity — all count,
  so long as the passage shows an inside, an outside, and this character's
  position across that line changing. Mere
  presence at a gathering is not inclusion, and absence is not exclusion;
  the boundary itself must be shown moving for this character.

Create status effects only when there is meaningful local movement.
Record **every distinct movement that meets its dimension's criterion**.
Most characters will still have 1 status effect, some 2; a dense social
scene may genuinely support more. There is no fixed cap, but distinctness
is strict:

* Two effects in the **same dimension** for one character are allowed only
  when they arise from clearly separate moments of the passage — different
  events, different witnesses, a different boundary — and could not honestly
  be summarized as one movement. Each must cite different `based_on_events`.
  When in doubt, summarize as one.
* Never restate one social fact as several effects.
* For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among
  `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position`:
  these are facets of the same contest, so choose the dimension that best
  names the movement rather than recording several facets of it.
* An event supports a dimension only when it meets that dimension's
  criterion, not when it merely brushes it.
* Do not collapse a real standing or belonging movement into
  `general_appraisal` to economize: a witticism that wins the room may be
  both `rhetorical_position` for the duel and `social_status` for the
  standing it visibly confers — record each on its own merits.

`delta` should reflect local movement in the passage:

Status delta:

* -2 = clearly diminished in this passage
* -1 = somewhat diminished
* 0 = do not use — if there is no clear movement, record no effect at all: null is not zero
* +1 = somewhat elevated
* +2 = clearly elevated

### `ambiguities`

Use this list to record uncertainty such as:

* ironic or layered narration
* uncertain evaluator
* ambiguous target
* uncertain reference resolution (who a surface form refers to)
* unclear endorsement by narrator or social voice

Default to an empty list.
Only add an ambiguity when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
Do not use `ambiguities` for routine caveats or general interpretive hedging.
Usually return an empty list.

### Confidence

* 0.0 to 1.0
* Be conservative when irony, layered narration, or reference resolution makes interpretation unstable.

## Important rules

* Named characters, plus only the reviewed unnamed figures on the reference sheet.
* Use the reference sheet's canonical names where a referent matches; use the
  passage's surface form verbatim with `"resolution": "unresolved"` where it
  does not. Never silently drop a materially involved character.
* `"resolution": "resolved"` may be omitted (it is the default); always state
  `"resolution": "unresolved"` explicitly.
* If a surface form is ambiguous, mention that in "ambiguities."
* Do not infer broad character arcs.
* Do not force zero-sum logic.
* A single event may affect both source and target, but record that through separate status effects if needed.
* Ignore trivial mentions that do not meaningfully alter evaluation or status.
* Do not add a winner/loser verdict field.
* Do not add a summary object.
* If there is no meaningful status movement, keep `appraisal_events` and `status_effects` empty rather than inventing a weak event.
* When narrator framing clearly guides the judgment, do not default to `neutral_report`.
* Do not turn one dominant movement into a chain of micro-events.
* Do not add balancing positive and negative effects unless both are central to the passage.
* Do not annotate every evaluatively charged phrase.
* Multiple quotations can support one event.
* If you are unsure between several event labels, pick the broadest stable one.

## Compression examples

These examples illustrate the intended first-pass compression.

Example A:

If a passage reveals that Swann is far more socially eminent than the family realizes, do **not** split this into:

* one event for narrator elevation
* one event for aristocratic association
* one event for local under-recognition

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_elevation`
* `1` main status effect: `social_status +2`

Example B:

If a passage exposes Legrandin’s evasive, socially defensive performance, do **not** split this into:

* ridicule
* humiliation
* blame
* rhetorical weakness
* emotional vulnerability

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_diminishment`
* `1` or `2` status effects at most, only if both are central

Example C:

If a passage shows Swann reaching long-desired intimacy with Odette through awkward pretext, hesitation, or dependence, do **not** reduce it to:

* one event for timidity
* one event for dependence
* one event for social compromise

Instead, prefer:

* `1` central event that preserves the realized intimacy or renewal
* a positive `emotional_position` effect when that attainment is the dominant local outcome
* a secondary note about hesitation or compromise only if it is itself central
* do **not** promote mere reunion relief unless the passage clearly crosses into intimacy or explicit renewal
* do **not** let a brief closing uplift outweigh the dominant movement of the passage unless that culminating turn is clearly the passage's main point

Example D:

If a passage shows a guest turned away at a hostess's door and then dwells
on that same refusal — the guest's confusion, the footman's repeated
message, the slow walk back down the staircase — that is **one** boundary
event:

* `1` event: `snub`
* `1` status effect: `inclusion_exclusion -2`

But if the same passage later shows the assembled room deferring to a newly
arrived title, that is a separate witnessed movement, for a different
character, grounded in its own event — record it on its own merits.

### Prior local context (optional)

— Tu ne peux t’imaginer ma douleur quand je pense à toi, reprit Bloch. Au fond, c’est un côté assez juif chez moi, ajouta-t-il ironiquement en rétrécissant sa prunelle comme s’il s’agissait de doser au microscope une quantité infinitésimale de « sang juif » et comme aurait pu le dire — mais ne l’eût pas dit — un grand seigneur français qui parmi ses ancêtres tous chrétiens eût pourtant compté Samuel Bernard ou plus anciennement encore la Sainte Vierge de qui prétendent descendre, dit-on, les Lévy — qui reparaît : « J’aime assez, ajouta-t-il, faire ainsi dans mes sentiments la part, assez mince d’ailleurs, qui peut tenir à mes origines juives ». Il prononça cette phrase parce que cela lui paraissait à la fois spirituel et brave de dire la vérité sur sa race, vérité que par la même occasion il s’arrangeait à atténuer singulièrement, comme les avares qui se décident à acquitter leurs dettes mais n’ont le courage d’en payer que la moitié. Ce genre de fraudes qui consiste à avoir l’audace de proclamer la vérité, mais en y mêlant, pour une bonne part, des mensonges qui la falsifient, est plus répandu qu’on ne pense et même, chez ceux qui ne le pratiquent pas habituellement, certaines crises dans la vie, notamment celles où une liaison amoureuse est en jeu, leur donnent l’occasion de s’y livrer.

### Passage

Toutes ces diatribes confidentielles de Bloch à Saint-Loup contre moi, à moi contre Saint-Loup finirent par une invitation à dîner. Je ne suis pas bien sûr qu’il ne fit pas d’abord une tentative pour avoir Saint-Loup seul. La vraisemblance rend cette tentative probable, le succès ne la couronna pas, car ce fut à moi et à Saint-Loup que Bloch dit un jour : « Cher maître, et vous, cavalier aimé d’Arès, de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, dompteur de chevaux, puisque je vous ai rencontrés sur le rivage d’Amphitrite résonnant d’écume, près des tentes des Ménier aux nefs rapides, voulez-vous tous deux venir dîner un jour de la semaine chez mon illustre père au cœur irréprochable ? » Il nous adressait cette invitation parce qu’il avait le désir de se lier plus étroitement avec Saint-Loup qui le ferait, espérait-il, pénétrer dans les milieux aristocratiques. Formé par moi, pour moi, ce souhait eût paru à Bloch la marque du plus hideux snobisme, bien conforme à l’opinion qu’il avait de tout un côté de ma nature qu’il ne jugeait pas, jusqu’ici du moins, le principal ; mais le même souhait, de sa part, lui semblait la preuve d’une belle curiosité de son intelligence désireuse de certains dépaysements sociaux où il pouvait peut-être trouver quelque utilité littéraire. M. Bloch père, quand son fils lui avait dit qu’il amènerait à dîner un de ses amis, dont il avait décliné sur un ton de satisfaction sarcastique le titre et le nom : « Le marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray » avait éprouvé une commotion violente. « Le marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray ! Ah ! bougre ! » s’était-il écrié, usant du juron qui était chez lui la marque la plus forte de la déférence sociale. Et il avait jeté sur son fils, capable de s’être fait de telles relations, un regard admiratif qui signifiait : « Il est vraiment étonnant. Ce prodige est-il mon enfant ? » et qui causa autant de plaisir à mon camarade que si cinquante francs avaient été ajoutés à sa pension mensuelle. Car Bloch était mal à l’aise chez lui et sentait que son père le traitait de dévoyé parce qu’il vivait dans l’admiration de Leconte de Lisle, Heredia et autres « bohèmes ». Mais des relations avec Saint-Loup-en-Bray dont le père avait été président du Canal de Suez ! (ah ! bougre !) c’était un résultat « indiscutable ». On regretta d’autant plus d’avoir laissé à Paris, par crainte de l’abîmer, le stéréoscope. Seul, M. Bloch, le père, avait l’art ou du moins le droit de s’en servir. Il ne le faisait du reste que rarement, à bon escient, les jours où il y avait gala et domestiques mâles en extra. De sorte que de ces séances de stéréoscope émanaient pour ceux qui y assistaient comme une distinction, une faveur de privilégiés, et pour le maître de maison qui les donnait un prestige analogue à celui que le talent confère et qui n’aurait pas pu être plus grand si les vues avaient été prises par M. Bloch lui-même et l’appareil de son invention. « Vous n’étiez pas invité hier chez Salomon ? disait-on dans la famille. — Non, je n’étais pas des élus ! — Qu’est-ce qu’il y avait ? — Un grand tralala, le stéréoscope, toute la boutique. — Ah ! s’il y avait le stéréoscope, je regrette, car il paraît que Salomon est extraordinaire quand il le montre. — Que veux-tu, dit M. Bloch à son fils, il ne faut pas lui donner tout à la fois, comme cela il lui restera quelque chose à désirer. » Il avait bien pensé dans sa tendresse paternelle et pour émouvoir son fils à faire venir l’instrument. Mais le « temps matériel » manquait, ou plutôt on avait cru qu’il manquerait ; mais nous dûmes faire remettre le dîner parce que Saint-Loup ne put se déplacer, attendant un oncle qui allait venir passer quarante-huit heures auprès de Mme de Villeparisis. Comme, très adonné aux exercices physiques, surtout aux longues marches, c’était en grande partie à pied, en couchant la nuit dans les fermes, que cet oncle devait faire la route depuis le château où il était en villégiature, le moment où il arriverait à Balbec était assez incertain. Et Saint-Loup n’osant bouger me chargea même d’aller porter à Incauville, où était le bureau télégraphique, la dépêche que mon ami envoyait quotidiennement à sa maîtresse. L’oncle qu’on attendait s’appelait Palamède, d’un prénom qu’il avait hérité des princes de Sicile ses ancêtres. Et plus tard quand je retrouvai dans mes lectures historiques, appartenant à tel podestat ou tel prince de l’Église, ce prénom même, belle médaille de la Renaissance — d’aucuns disaient un véritable antique — toujours restée dans la famille, ayant glissé de descendant en descendant depuis le cabinet du Vatican jusqu’à l’oncle de mon ami, j’éprouvais le plaisir réservé à ceux qui ne pouvant faute d’argent constituer un médaillier, une pinacothèque, recherchent les vieux noms (noms de localités, documentaires et pittoresques comme une carte ancienne, une vue cavalière, une enseigne ou un coutumier, noms de baptême où résonne et s’entend, dans les belles finales françaises, le défaut de langue, l’intonation d’une vulgarité ethnique, la prononciation vicieuse selon lesquels nos ancêtres faisaient subir aux mots latins et saxons des mutilations durables devenues plus tard les augustes législatrices des grammaires) et en somme, grâce à ces collections de sonorités anciennes, se donnent à eux-mêmes des concerts à la façon de ceux qui acquièrent des violes de gambe et des violes d’amour pour jouer de la musique d’autrefois sur des instruments anciens. Saint-Loup me dit que même dans la société aristocratique la plus fermée son oncle Palamède se distinguait encore comme particulièrement difficile d’accès, dédaigneux, entiché de sa noblesse, formant avec la femme de son frère et quelques autres personnes choisies ce qu’on appelait le cercle des Phénix. Là même il était si redouté pour ses insolences qu’autrefois il était arrivé que des gens du monde qui désiraient le connaître et s’étaient adressés à son propre frère avaient essuyé un refus. « Non, ne me demandez pas de vous présenter à mon frère Palamède. Ma femme, nous tous, nous nous y attellerions que nous ne pourrions pas. Ou bien vous risqueriez qu’il ne soit pas aimable et je ne le voudrais pas. » Au Jockey, il avait avec quelques amis désigné deux cents membres qu’ils ne se laisseraient jamais présenter. Et chez le comte de Paris il était connu sous le sobriquet du « Prince » à cause de son élégance et de sa fierté.

Saint-Loup me parla de la jeunesse, depuis longtemps passée, de son oncle. Il amenait tous les jours des femmes dans une garçonnière qu’il avait en commun avec deux de ses amis, beaux comme lui, ce qui faisait qu’on les appelait « les trois Grâces ».

— Un jour un des hommes qui est aujourd’hui des plus en vue dans le faubourg Saint-Germain, comme eût dit Balzac, mais qui dans une première période assez fâcheuse montrait des goûts bizarres, avait demandé à mon oncle de venir dans cette garçonnière. Mais à peine arrivé ce ne fut pas aux femmes, mais à mon oncle Palamède, qu’il se mit à faire une déclaration. Mon oncle fit semblant de ne pas comprendre, emmena sous un prétexte ses deux amis, ils revinrent, prirent le coupable, le déshabillèrent, le frappèrent jusqu’au sang, et par un froid de dix degrés au-dessous de zéro le jetèrent à coups de pieds dehors où il fut trouvé à demi mort, si bien que la justice fit une enquête à laquelle le malheureux eut toute la peine du monde à la faire renoncer. Mon oncle ne se livrerait plus aujourd’hui à une exécution aussi cruelle et tu n’imagines pas le nombre d’hommes du peuple, lui si hautain avec les gens du monde, qu’il prend en affection, qu’il protège, quitte à être payé d’ingratitude. Ce sera un domestique qui l’aura servi dans un hôtel et qu’il placera à Paris, ou un paysan à qui il fera apprendre un métier. C’est même le côté assez gentil qu’il y a chez lui, par contraste avec le côté mondain. » Saint-Loup appartenait, en effet, à ce genre de jeunes gens du monde, situés à une altitude où on ait pu faire pousser ces expressions : « Ce qu’il y a même d’assez gentil chez lui, son côté assez gentil », semences assez précieuses, produisant très vite une manière de concevoir les choses dans laquelle on se compte pour rien, et le « peuple » pour tout ; en somme tout le contraire de l’orgueil plébéien. « Il paraît qu’on ne peut se figurer comme il donnait le ton, comme il faisait la loi à toute la société dans sa jeunesse. Pour lui en toute circonstance il faisait ce qui lui paraissait le plus agréable, le plus commode, mais aussitôt c’était imité par les snobs. S’il avait eu soif au théâtre et s’était fait apporter à boire dans le fond de sa loge, les petits salons qu’il y avait derrière chacune se remplissaient, la semaine suivante, de rafraîchissements. Un été pluvieux où il avait un peu de rhumatisme, il s’était commandé un pardessus d’une vigogne souple mais chaude qui ne sert que pour faire des couvertures de voyage et dont il avait respecté les raies bleues et orange. Les grands tailleurs se virent commander aussitôt par leurs clients des pardessus bleus et frangés, à longs poils. Si pour une raison quelconque il désirait ôter tout caractère de solennité à un dîner dans un château où il passait une journée, et pour marquer cette nuance n’avait pas apporté d’habit et s’était mis à table avec le veston de l’après-midi, la mode devenait de dîner à la campagne en veston. Que pour manger un gâteau il se servît, au lieu de sa cuiller, d’une fourchette ou d’un couvert de son invention commandé par lui à un orfèvre, ou de ses doigts, il n’était plus permis de faire autrement. Il avait eu envie de réentendre certains quatuors de Beethoven (car avec toutes ses idées saugrenues il est loin d’être bête, et est fort doué) et avait fait venir des artistes pour les jouer chaque semaine, pour lui et quelques amis. La grande élégance fut cette année-là de donner des réunions peu nombreuses où on entendait de la musique de chambre. Je crois d’ailleurs qu’il ne s’est pas ennuyé dans la vie. Beau comme il a été, il a dû avoir des femmes ! Je ne pourrais pas vous dire d’ailleurs exactement lesquelles parce qu’il est très discret. Mais je sais qu’il a bien trompé ma pauvre tante. Ce qui n’empêche pas qu’il était délicieux avec elle, qu’elle l’adorait, et qu’il l’a pleurée pendant des années. Quand il est à Paris, il va encore au cimetière presque chaque jour. »

Le lendemain du jour où Robert m’avait ainsi parlé de son oncle tout en l’attendant, vainement du reste, comme je passais seul devant le casino en rentrant à l’hôtel, j’eus la sensation d’être regardé par quelqu’un qui n’était pas loin de moi. Je tournai la tête et j’aperçus un homme d’une quarantaine d’années, très grand et assez gros, avec des moustaches très noires, et qui, tout en frappant nerveusement son pantalon avec une badine, fixait sur moi des yeux dilatés par l’attention. Par moments, ils étaient percés en tous sens par des regards d’une extrême activité comme en ont seuls devant une personne qu’ils ne connaissent pas des hommes à qui, pour un motif quelconque, elle inspire des pensées qui ne viendraient pas à tout autre — par exemple, des fous ou des espions. Il lança sur moi une suprême œillade à la fois hardie, prudente, rapide et profonde, comme un dernier coup que l’on tire au moment de prendre la fuite, et après avoir regardé tout autour de lui, prenant soudain un air distrait et hautain, par un brusque revirement de toute sa personne il se tourna vers une affiche dans la lecture de laquelle il s’absorba, en fredonnant un air et en arrangeant la rose mousseuse qui pendait à sa boutonnière. Il sortit de sa poche un calepin sur lequel il eut l’air de prendre en note le titre du spectacle annoncé, tira deux ou trois fois sa montre, abaissa sur ses yeux un canotier de paille noire dont il prolongea le rebord avec sa main mise en visière comme pour voir si quelqu’un n’arrivait pas, fit le geste de mécontentement par lequel on croit faire voir qu’on a assez d’attendre, mais qu’on ne fait jamais quand on attend réellement, puis rejetant en arrière son chapeau et laissant voir une brosse coupée ras qui admettait cependant de chaque côté d’assez longues ailes de pigeon ondulées, il exhala le souffle bruyant des personnes qui ont non trop chaud mais le désir de montrer qu’elles ont trop chaud. J’eus l’idée d’un escroc d’hôtel qui, nous ayant peut-être déjà remarqués les jours précédents ma grand’mère et moi, et préparant quelque mauvais coup, venait de s’apercevoir que je l’avais surpris pendant qu’il m’épiait ; pour me donner le change, peut-être cherchait-il seulement par sa nouvelle attitude à exprimer la distraction et le détachement, mais c’était avec une exagération si agressive que son but semblait, au moins autant que de dissiper les soupçons que j’avais dû avoir, de venger une humiliation qu’à mon insu je lui eusse infligée, de me donner l’idée non pas tant qu’il ne m’avait pas vu, que celle que j’étais un objet de trop petite importance pour attirer l’attention. Il cambrait sa taille d’un air de bravade, pinçait les lèvres, relevait ses moustaches et dans son regard ajustait quelque chose d’indifférent, de dur, de presque insultant. Si bien que la singularité de son expression me le faisait prendre tantôt pour un voleur et tantôt pour un aliéné. Pourtant sa mise extrêmement soignée était beaucoup plus grave et beaucoup plus simple que celles de tous les baigneurs que je voyais à Balbec, et rassurante pour mon veston si souvent humilié par la blancheur éclatante et banale de leurs costumes de plage. Mais ma grand’mère venait à ma rencontre, nous fîmes un tour ensemble et je l’attendais, une heure après, devant l’hôtel où elle était rentrée un instant, quand je vis sortir Mme de Villeparisis avec Robert de Saint-Loup et l’inconnu qui m’avait regardé si fixement devant le casino. Avec la rapidité d’un éclair son regard me traversa, ainsi qu’au moment où je l’avais aperçu, et revint, comme s’il ne m’avait pas vu, se ranger, un peu bas, devant ses yeux, émoussé comme le regard neutre qui feint de ne rien voir au dehors et n’est capable de rien dire au dedans, le regard qui exprime seulement la satisfaction de sentir autour de soi les cils qu’il écarte de sa rondeur béate, le regard dévot et confit qu’ont certains hypocrites, le regard fat qu’ont certains sots. Je vis qu’il avait changé de costume. Celui qu’il portait était encore plus sombre ; et sans doute c’est que la véritable élégance est moins loin de la simplicité que la fausse ; mais il y avait autre chose : d’un peu près on sentait que si la couleur était presque entièrement absente de ces vêtements, ce n’était pas parce que celui qui l’en avait bannie y était indifférent, mais plutôt parce que pour une raison quelconque il se l’interdisait. Et la sobriété qu’ils laissaient paraître semblait de celles qui viennent de l’obéissance à un régime, plutôt que de manque de gourmandise. Un filet de vert sombre s’harmonisait dans le tissu du pantalon à la rayure des chaussettes avec un raffinement qui décelait la vivacité d’un goût maté partout ailleurs et à qui cette seule concession avait été faite par tolérance, tandis qu’une tache rouge sur la cravate était imperceptible comme une liberté qu’on n’ose prendre.

— Comment allez-vous ? Je vous présente mon neveu, le baron de Guermantes, me dit Mme de Villeparisis, pendant que l’inconnu, sans me regarder, grommelant un vague : « Charmé » qu’il fit suivre de : « Heue, heue, heue » pour donner à son amabilité quelque chose de forcé, et repliant le petit doigt, l’index et le pouce, me tendait le troisième doigt et l’annulaire, dépourvus de toute bague, que je serrai sous son gant de Suède ; puis sans avoir levé les yeux sur moi il se détourna vers Mme de Villeparisis.
