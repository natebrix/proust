You are annotating a French passage from Marcel Proust's *À la recherche du temps perdu* for **local appraisal events** and **character status effects**.

Your purpose is to generate structured literary-social annotations that can later be transformed into different notions of "winning" and "losing."
Do **not** reduce the passage to a single winner-loser verdict unless the evidence is overwhelmingly explicit.
Instead, identify the **dominant local evaluative acts** and their consequences for the named characters.

## Inputs

You will be given:

1. A French passage. The text is Proust's original, unaltered.
2. A **reference sheet** of known characters and their surface forms for this
   chapter, including a small reviewed set of individuated unnamed figures
   (e.g. l'amie de Mlle Vinteuil) and resolution notes for family references
   ("ma grand'mère", "maman").
3. Optionally, brief prior context from the immediately preceding window.

## Scope rules

* The reference sheet is **advisory context, not a constraint on who exists**.
  When a referent in the passage matches an entry, use that entry's canonical
  name.
* List **every named character materially involved** in the passage's
  evaluative or social dynamics — including characters **not** on the
  reference sheet. For those, use the passage's surface form verbatim as
  `canonical_name` and add `"resolution": "unresolved"` to their
  `characters_present` entry.
* Unnamed figures are included only when they appear on the reference sheet
  as reviewed entries; do not invent descriptor-identified characters beyond
  the sheet.
* Work primarily from the passage itself.
* Use prior context only for local disambiguation of references, not for broad plot inference.
* Do not invent motives, unstated events, or long-run arc interpretations.
* Prefer the **smallest sufficient reading** of the passage.

## What to detect

Track local shifts in how named characters are positioned through:

* praise
* blame
* admiration
* snub
* prestige by association
* discredit by association
* narrated elevation or diminishment
* inclusion in or exclusion from valued social space
* signs that another character depends on, yields to, or dismisses them

For this first pass, prefer **broad, stable categories** over fine-grained distinctions.
Do not split one local movement into multiple event labels unless the passage clearly stages them as distinct.

## Interpretive principles

A character may come out ahead or behind in several ways:

* directly, by being praised or insulted
* comparatively, by being favored over another
* socially, by being included, deferred to, or excluded
* rhetorically, by speaking with force, wit, authority, or discernment
* emotionally, by gaining leverage over another character
* associationally, by benefiting from or suffering through a linked person
* narratively, through a passage that appears to elevate or diminish them

Do **not** judge:

* morality
* factual correctness
* long-term importance
* whether the character "deserves" the treatment

Judge only the **local evaluative and social dynamics** of the supplied passage.

## Special caution for Proust

Proust often layers evaluation through:

* quoted speech
* free indirect style
* remembered perception
* irony
* narrator distance
* social codes that are reported rather than endorsed

For every evaluative event, distinguish:

* who is making the evaluation
* who is its target
* whether the passage appears to endorse, neutrally report, ironize, or leave uncertain that evaluation

## Special rule for consummation and renewal

In erotic or affective passages, distinguish between:

* the mode of attainment
* the attained local outcome

Timidity, dependence, awkwardness, compromise, or ironic framing may qualify how an outcome is reached, but they do **not** by themselves override a plainly successful local outcome.

If the passage culminates in any of the following, that dominant positive movement must be represented in the annotation:

* realized intimacy
* mutual receptivity
* successful consummation
* narrator-endorsed emotional renewal

Do **not** collapse such passages into pure diminishment merely because the path to that outcome is hesitant, dependent, socially compromising, or lightly ironized.
When both weakness and successful renewal coexist, preserve the dominant local success and mention the qualifying weakness only if it is central.
Do **not** treat mere reunion, temporary relief, or the end of uncertainty as equivalent to consummation or renewal.
Relief at finding the desired person again counts as dominant positive movement only if the passage itself goes on to show realized intimacy, mutual receptivity, or an explicitly narrator-endorsed affective transformation.
Weigh the passage as a whole rather than over-privileging its final sentence or final image.
Do **not** let a single upbeat note, however striking or late-placed, outweigh a passage whose dominant body is organized around anxious search, dependency, agitation, jealousy, or diminishment unless the passage is plainly structured so that the culmination redefines the whole local movement.
If most of the passage is governed by distress and only a brief closing note offers relief, prefer a mixed or negative reading unless the text clearly presents that closing turn as the main narrated point.

## Task

1. Identify only the named characters who are materially involved in the dominant local movement.
2. Extract only the **significant** appraisal or status-relevant events.
3. Record only the dominant local status effects for the characters involved.
4. Note ambiguity only when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
5. Multiple characters may gain or lose simultaneously.
6. If there is no meaningful status movement, return empty `appraisal_events` and empty `status_effects`.
7. Prefer fewer, high-quality events over many trivial ones.
8. Default to **1 main event** for a passage.
9. Use **2 events only** when the passage clearly contains two distinct, non-redundant local movements.
10. Do not add balancing or countervailing events unless they are central to the passage.
11. Never return more than **2 appraisal events**.
12. Never return more than **2 status effects** for a single character.

## Schema guidance

Use a reduced first-pass schema.

Do not add fields beyond the schema above.

### `characters_present`

Include only named characters who are either:

* explicitly mentioned in the passage
* clearly implicated by nearby reference in the passage or optional prior context

Do **not** include every discourse participant.
Include a character only if omitting them would distort the dominant local appraisal or status movement.
Peripheral parents, relatives, or bystanders should usually be omitted in this first pass.

### `appraisal_events`

Record only significant local evaluative or status-relevant events.

Prefer fewer, stronger events over exhaustive tagging.
Default to **1 event**.
Use **2 events** only when the passage clearly contains two distinct movements that are both central.
Never emit more than **2 events** total.

Good reasons to create an event:

* one character is praised, admired, deferred to, or favored
* one character is blamed, ridiculed, excluded, snubbed, or diminished
* a comparison clearly puts one character above or below another
* a character gains or loses rhetorical or emotional leverage
* association with another figure clearly raises or lowers local standing

Bad reasons to create a separate event:

* a subordinate nuance merely restates the same local movement
* a quoted phrase provides color but not a distinct appraisal act
* a possible counter-reading is present but not central
* a nearby character is involved in the scene but not in the main evaluative movement
* one sentence offers several pieces of evidence for the same local movement
* the same movement could be described with several nearby labels

Prefer these broad labels when possible:

* `narrated_diminishment`
* `narrated_elevation`
* `snub`
* `admiration`
* `blame`
* `prestige_association`
* `discredit_association`

Avoid finer-grained labels unless the passage truly demands them.
Choose the **single best label** for the dominant movement rather than enumerating nearby alternatives.

### `status_effects`

Use these dimensions only. Each is governed by its own criterion:

* `general_appraisal` — the passage's evaluative verdict on a character:
  praised, admired, ridiculed, or discredited in the narration or the scene.
* `rhetorical_position` — the upper hand in talk: wit that lands or misfires,
  an argument won or lost, a line that silences or is silenced.
* `emotional_position` — emotional leverage in a relation: who needs, who
  withholds, who suffers visibly, who controls.
* `social_status` — a movement or display of standing that is **witnessed
  inside the world of the passage**. Someone present — or society's reported
  voice — must register it: deference given or withheld, a reception or
  invitation that marks rank, a public snub, a reputation spoken of as risen
  or fallen. A private, unshared judgment of a character is
  `general_appraisal`, not `social_status`.
* `inclusion_exclusion` — a **boundary event**: a circle with an inside and
  an outside, and a character shown crossing that line or barred at it —
  introduced or not introduced, greeted or cut, invited or left out, absorbed
  into the group or held at its edge. Mere presence at a gathering is not
  inclusion, and absence is not exclusion; the boundary itself must be shown
  moving for this character.

Create status effects only when there is meaningful local movement.
Record **every distinct movement that meets its dimension's criterion**.
Most characters will still have 1 status effect, some 2; a dense social
scene may genuinely support more. There is no fixed cap, but distinctness
is strict:

* Two effects in the **same dimension** for one character are allowed only
  when they arise from clearly separate moments of the passage — different
  events, different witnesses, a different boundary — and could not honestly
  be summarized as one movement. Each must cite different `based_on_events`.
  When in doubt, summarize as one.
* Never restate one social fact as several effects.
* An event supports a dimension only when it meets that dimension's
  criterion, not when it merely brushes it.
* Do not collapse a real standing or belonging movement into
  `general_appraisal` to economize: a witticism that wins the room may be
  both `rhetorical_position` for the duel and `social_status` for the
  standing it visibly confers — record each on its own merits.

`delta` should reflect local movement in the passage:

Status delta:

* -2 = clearly diminished in this passage
* -1 = somewhat diminished
* 0 = neutral, mixed, or no clear movement
* +1 = somewhat elevated
* +2 = clearly elevated

### `ambiguities`

Use this list to record uncertainty such as:

* ironic or layered narration
* uncertain evaluator
* ambiguous target
* uncertain reference resolution (who a surface form refers to)
* unclear endorsement by narrator or social voice

Default to an empty list.
Only add an ambiguity when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
Do not use `ambiguities` for routine caveats or general interpretive hedging.
Usually return an empty list.

### Confidence

* 0.0 to 1.0
* Be conservative when irony, layered narration, or reference resolution makes interpretation unstable.

## Important rules

* Named characters, plus only the reviewed unnamed figures on the reference sheet.
* Use the reference sheet's canonical names where a referent matches; use the
  passage's surface form verbatim with `"resolution": "unresolved"` where it
  does not. Never silently drop a materially involved character.
* `"resolution": "resolved"` may be omitted (it is the default); always state
  `"resolution": "unresolved"` explicitly.
* If a surface form is ambiguous, mention that in "ambiguities."
* Do not infer broad character arcs.
* Do not force zero-sum logic.
* A single event may affect both source and target, but record that through separate status effects if needed.
* Ignore trivial mentions that do not meaningfully alter evaluation or status.
* Do not add a winner/loser verdict field.
* Do not add a summary object.
* If there is no meaningful status movement, keep `appraisal_events` and `status_effects` empty rather than inventing a weak event.
* When narrator framing clearly guides the judgment, do not default to `neutral_report`.
* Do not turn one dominant movement into a chain of micro-events.
* Do not add balancing positive and negative effects unless both are central to the passage.
* Do not annotate every evaluatively charged phrase.
* Multiple quotations can support one event.
* If you are unsure between several event labels, pick the broadest stable one.

## Compression examples

These examples illustrate the intended first-pass compression.

Example A:

If a passage reveals that Swann is far more socially eminent than the family realizes, do **not** split this into:

* one event for narrator elevation
* one event for aristocratic association
* one event for local under-recognition

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_elevation`
* `1` main status effect: `social_status +2`

Example B:

If a passage exposes Legrandin’s evasive, socially defensive performance, do **not** split this into:

* ridicule
* humiliation
* blame
* rhetorical weakness
* emotional vulnerability

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_diminishment`
* `1` or `2` status effects at most, only if both are central

Example C:

If a passage shows Swann reaching long-desired intimacy with Odette through awkward pretext, hesitation, or dependence, do **not** reduce it to:

* one event for timidity
* one event for dependence
* one event for social compromise

Instead, prefer:

* `1` central event that preserves the realized intimacy or renewal
* a positive `emotional_position` effect when that attainment is the dominant local outcome
* a secondary note about hesitation or compromise only if it is itself central
* do **not** promote mere reunion relief unless the passage clearly crosses into intimacy or explicit renewal
* do **not** let a brief closing uplift outweigh the dominant movement of the passage unless that culminating turn is clearly the passage's main point

Example D:

If a passage shows a guest turned away at a hostess's door and then dwells
on that same refusal — the guest's confusion, the footman's repeated
message, the slow walk back down the staircase — that is **one** boundary
event:

* `1` event: `snub`
* `1` status effect: `inclusion_exclusion -2`

But if the same passage later shows the assembled room deferring to a newly
arrived title, that is a separate witnessed movement, for a different
character, grounded in its own event — record it on its own merits.

### Passage

J’étais arrivé à une presque complète indifférence à l’égard de Gilberte, quand deux ans plus tard je partis avec ma grand’mère pour Balbec. Quand je subissais le charme d’un visage nouveau, quand c’était à l’aide d’une autre jeune fille que j’espérais connaître les cathédrales gothiques, les palais et les jardins de l’Italie, je me disais tristement que notre amour, en tant qu’il est l’amour d’une certaine créature, n’est peut-être pas quelque chose de bien réel, puisque si des associations de rêveries agréables ou douloureuses peuvent le lier pendant quelque temps à une femme jusqu’à nous faire penser qu’il a été inspiré par elle d’une façon nécessaire, en revanche si nous nous dégageons volontairement ou à notre insu de ces associations, cet amour, comme s’il était au contraire spontané et venait de nous seuls, renaît pour se donner à une autre femme. Pourtant au moment de ce départ pour Balbec, et pendant les premiers temps de mon séjour, mon indifférence n’était encore qu’intermittente. Souvent (notre vie étant si peu chronologique, interférant tant d’anachronismes dans la suite des jours), je vivais dans ceux, plus anciens que la veille ou l’avant-veille, où j’aimais Gilberte. Alors ne plus la voir m’était soudain douloureux, comme c’eût été dans ce temps-là. Le moi qui l’avait aimée, remplacé déjà presque entièrement par un autre, resurgissait, et il m’était rendu beaucoup plus fréquemment par une chose futile que par une chose importante. Par exemple, pour anticiper sur mon séjour en Normandie, j’entendis à Balbec un inconnu que je croisai sur la digue dire : « La famille du directeur du ministère des Postes. » Or (comme je ne savais pas alors l’influence que cette famille devait avoir sur ma vie), ce propos aurait dû me paraître oiseux, mais il me causa une vive souffrance, celle qu’éprouvait un moi, aboli pour une grande part depuis longtemps, à être séparé de Gilberte. C’est que jamais je n’avais repensé à une conversation que Gilberte avait eue devant moi avec son père, relativement à la famille du « directeur du ministère des Postes ». Or, les souvenirs d’amour ne font pas exception aux lois générales de la mémoire, elles-mêmes régies par les lois plus générales de l’habitude. Comme celle-ci affaiblit tout, ce qui nous rappelle le mieux un être, c’est justement ce que nous avions oublié (parce que c’était insignifiant et que nous lui avions ainsi laissé toute sa force). C’est pourquoi la meilleure part de notre mémoire est hors de nous, dans un souffle pluvieux, dans l’odeur de renfermé d’une chambre ou dans l’odeur d’une première flambée, partout où nous retrouvons de nous-même ce que notre intelligence, n’en ayant pas l’emploi, avait dédaigné, la dernière réserve du passé, la meilleure, celle qui, quand toutes nos larmes semblent taries, sait nous faire pleurer encore. Hors de nous ? En nous pour mieux dire, mais dérobée à nos propres regards, dans un oubli plus ou moins prolongé. C’est grâce à cet oubli seul que nous pouvons de temps à autre retrouver l’être que nous fûmes, nous placer vis-à-vis des choses comme cet être l’était, souffrir à nouveau, parce que nous ne sommes plus nous, mais lui, et qu’il aimait ce qui nous est maintenant indifférent. Au grand jour de la mémoire habituelle, les images du passé pâlissent peu à peu, s’effacent, il ne reste plus rien d’elles, nous ne le retrouverons plus. Ou plutôt nous ne le retrouverions plus, si quelques mots (comme « directeur au ministère des Postes ») n’avaient été soigneusement enfermés dans l’oubli, de même qu’on dépose à la Bibliothèque Nationale un exemplaire d’un livre qui sans cela risquerait de devenir introuvable.

Mais cette souffrance et ce regain d’amour pour Gilberte ne furent pas plus longs que ceux qu’on a en rêve, et cette fois, au contraire, parce qu’à Balbec l’Habitude ancienne n’était plus là pour les faire durer. Et si ces effets de l’Habitude semblent contradictoires, c’est qu’elle obéit à des lois multiples. À Paris j’étais devenu de plus en plus indifférent à Gilberte, grâce à l’Habitude. Le changement d’habitude, c’est-à-dire la cessation momentanée de l’Habitude, paracheva l’œuvre de l’Habitude quand je partis pour Balbec. Elle affaiblit mais stabilise, elle amène la désagrégation mais la fait durer indéfiniment. Chaque jour depuis des années je calquais tant bien que mal mon état d’âme sur celui de la veille. À Balbec un lit nouveau à côté duquel on m’apportait le matin un petit déjeuner différent de celui de Paris ne devait plus soutenir les pensées dont s’était nourri mon amour pour Gilberte : il y a des cas (assez rares il est vrai) où, la sédentarité immobilisant les jours, le meilleur moyen de gagner du temps, c’est de changer de place. Mon voyage à Balbec fut comme la première sortie d’un convalescent qui n’attendait plus qu’elle pour s’apercevoir qu’il est guéri.

Ce voyage, on le ferait sans doute aujourd’hui en automobile, croyant le rendre ainsi plus agréable. On verra, qu’accompli de cette façon, il serait même en un sens plus vrai puisqu’on y suivrait de plus près, dans une intimité plus étroite, les diverses gradations par lesquelles change la surface de la terre. Mais enfin le plaisir spécifique du voyage n’est pas de pouvoir descendre en route et de s’arrêter quand on est fatigué, c’est de rendre la différence entre le départ et l’arrivée non pas aussi insensible, mais aussi profonde qu’on peut, de la ressentir dans sa totalité, intacte, telle qu’elle était dans notre pensée quand notre imagination nous portait du lieu où nous vivions jusqu’au cœur d’un lieu désiré, en un bond qui nous semblait moins miraculeux parce qu’il franchissait une distance que parce qu’il unissait deux individualités distinctes de la terre, qu’il nous menait d’un nom à un autre nom ; et que schématise (mieux qu’une promenade où, comme on débarque où l’on veut, il n’y a guère plus d’arrivée) l’opération mystérieuse qui s’accomplissait dans ces lieux spéciaux, les gares, lesquels ne font pas partie pour ainsi dire de la ville mais contiennent l’essence de sa personnalité de même que sur un écriteau signalétique elles portent son nom.

Mais en tout genre, notre temps a la manie de vouloir ne montrer les choses qu’avec ce qui les entoure dans la réalité, et par là de supprimer l’essentiel, l’acte de l’esprit, qui les isola d’elle. On « présente » un tableau au milieu de meubles, de bibelots, de tentures de la même époque, fade décor qu’excelle à composer dans les hôtels d’aujourd’hui la maîtresse de maison la plus ignorante la veille, passant maintenant ses journées dans les archives et les bibliothèques, et au milieu duquel le chef-d’œuvre qu’on regarde tout en dînant ne nous donne pas la même enivrante joie qu’on ne doit lui demander que dans une salle de musée, laquelle symbolise bien mieux, par sa nudité et son dépouillement de toutes particularités, les espaces intérieurs où l’artiste s’est abstrait pour créer.

Malheureusement ces lieux merveilleux que sont les gares, d’où l’on part pour une destination éloignée, sont aussi des lieux tragiques, car si le miracle s’y accomplit grâce auquel les pays qui n’avaient encore d’existence que dans notre pensée vont être ceux au milieu desquels nous vivrons, pour cette raison même il faut renoncer au sortir de la salle d’attente à retrouver tout à l’heure la chambre familière où l’on était il y a un instant encore. Il faut laisser toute espérance de rentrer coucher chez soi, une fois qu’on s’est décidé à pénétrer dans l’antre empesté par où l’on accède au mystère, dans un de ces grands ateliers vitrés, comme celui de Saint-Lazare où j’allais chercher le train de Balbec, et qui déployait au-dessus de la ville éventrée un de ces immenses ciels crus et gros de menaces amoncelées de drame, pareils à certains ciels, d’une modernité presque parisienne, de Mantegna ou de Véronèse, et sous lequel ne pouvait s’accomplir que quelque acte terrible et solennel comme un départ en chemin de fer ou l’érection de la Croix.
