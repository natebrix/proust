You are annotating a French passage from Marcel Proust's *À la recherche du temps perdu* for **local appraisal events** and **character status effects**.

Your purpose is to generate structured literary-social annotations that can later be transformed into different notions of "winning" and "losing."
Do **not** reduce the passage to a single winner-loser verdict unless the evidence is overwhelmingly explicit.
Instead, identify the **dominant local evaluative acts** and their consequences for the named characters.

## Inputs

You will be given:

1. A French passage. The text is Proust's original, unaltered.
2. A **reference sheet** of known characters and their surface forms for this
   chapter, including a small reviewed set of individuated unnamed figures
   (e.g. l'amie de Mlle Vinteuil) and resolution notes for family references
   ("ma grand'mère", "maman").
3. Optionally, brief prior context from the immediately preceding window.

## Scope rules

* The reference sheet is **advisory context, not a constraint on who exists**.
  When a referent in the passage matches an entry, use that entry's canonical
  name.
* List **every named character materially involved** in the passage's
  evaluative or social dynamics — including characters **not** on the
  reference sheet. For those, use the passage's surface form verbatim as
  `canonical_name` and add `"resolution": "unresolved"` to their
  `characters_present` entry.
* Unnamed figures are included only when they appear on the reference sheet
  as reviewed entries; do not invent descriptor-identified characters beyond
  the sheet.
* Work primarily from the passage itself.
* Use prior context only for local disambiguation of references, not for broad plot inference.
* Do not invent motives, unstated events, or long-run arc interpretations.
* Prefer the **smallest sufficient reading** of the passage.

## What to detect

Track local shifts in how named characters are positioned through:

* praise
* blame
* admiration
* snub
* prestige by association
* discredit by association
* narrated elevation or diminishment
* inclusion in or exclusion from valued social space
* signs that another character depends on, yields to, or dismisses them

For this first pass, prefer **broad, stable categories** over fine-grained distinctions.
Do not split one local movement into multiple event labels unless the passage clearly stages them as distinct.

## Interpretive principles

A character may come out ahead or behind in several ways:

* directly, by being praised or insulted
* comparatively, by being favored over another
* socially, by being included, deferred to, or excluded
* rhetorically, by speaking with force, wit, authority, or discernment
* emotionally, by gaining leverage over another character
* associationally, by benefiting from or suffering through a linked person
* narratively, through a passage that appears to elevate or diminish them

Do **not** judge:

* morality
* factual correctness
* long-term importance
* whether the character "deserves" the treatment

Judge only the **local evaluative and social dynamics** of the supplied passage.

## Special caution for Proust

Proust often layers evaluation through:

* quoted speech
* free indirect style
* remembered perception
* irony
* narrator distance
* social codes that are reported rather than endorsed

For every evaluative event, distinguish:

* who is making the evaluation
* who is its target
* whether the passage appears to endorse, neutrally report, ironize, or leave uncertain that evaluation

## Special rule for consummation and renewal

In erotic or affective passages, distinguish between:

* the mode of attainment
* the attained local outcome

Timidity, dependence, awkwardness, compromise, or ironic framing may qualify how an outcome is reached, but they do **not** by themselves override a plainly successful local outcome.

If the passage culminates in any of the following, that dominant positive movement must be represented in the annotation:

* realized intimacy
* mutual receptivity
* successful consummation
* narrator-endorsed emotional renewal

Do **not** collapse such passages into pure diminishment merely because the path to that outcome is hesitant, dependent, socially compromising, or lightly ironized.
When both weakness and successful renewal coexist, preserve the dominant local success and mention the qualifying weakness only if it is central.
Do **not** treat mere reunion, temporary relief, or the end of uncertainty as equivalent to consummation or renewal.
Relief at finding the desired person again counts as dominant positive movement only if the passage itself goes on to show realized intimacy, mutual receptivity, or an explicitly narrator-endorsed affective transformation.
Weigh the passage as a whole rather than over-privileging its final sentence or final image.
Do **not** let a single upbeat note, however striking or late-placed, outweigh a passage whose dominant body is organized around anxious search, dependency, agitation, jealousy, or diminishment unless the passage is plainly structured so that the culmination redefines the whole local movement.
If most of the passage is governed by distress and only a brief closing note offers relief, prefer a mixed or negative reading unless the text clearly presents that closing turn as the main narrated point.

## Task

1. Identify only the named characters who are materially involved in the dominant local movement.
2. Extract only the **significant** appraisal or status-relevant events.
3. Record only the dominant local status effects for the characters involved.
4. Note ambiguity only when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
5. Multiple characters may gain or lose simultaneously.
6. If there is no meaningful status movement, return empty `appraisal_events` and empty `status_effects`.
7. Prefer fewer, high-quality events over many trivial ones.
8. Default to **1 main event** for a passage.
9. Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct, non-redundant local movements.
10. A dense social scene — several characters, several separately witnessed movements — may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct movement that the others do not cover. Never return more than **4 appraisal events**.
11. Do not add balancing or countervailing events unless they are central to the passage.
12. For one character: at most **one status effect per dimension**. A second effect in the same dimension is allowed only for clearly separate moments of the passage, each citing different `based_on_events`.
13. For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position` — these are facets of the same contest; choose the dimension that best names the movement. The same event may additionally ground a `social_status` or `inclusion_exclusion` effect for that character when that dimension's own criterion is independently met.

## Schema guidance

Use a reduced first-pass schema.

Do not add fields beyond the schema above.

### `characters_present`

Include only named characters who are either:

* explicitly mentioned in the passage
* clearly implicated by nearby reference in the passage or optional prior context

Do **not** include every discourse participant.
Include a character only if omitting them would distort the dominant local appraisal or status movement.
Peripheral parents, relatives, or bystanders should usually be omitted in this first pass.

### `appraisal_events`

Record only significant local evaluative or status-relevant events.

Prefer fewer, stronger events over exhaustive tagging.
Default to **1 event**.
Use **2 events** when the passage clearly contains two distinct movements that are both central.
A dense social scene may carry up to **4 events** when each grounds a distinct
witnessed movement that the others do not cover — a salon may snub one guest,
crown another, and watch a third fall in the same evening. This is not license
to fragment: every "bad reason to create an event" below still applies, and an
event that merely restates or elaborates another must not be added.
Never emit more than **4 events** total.

Good reasons to create an event:

* one character is praised, admired, deferred to, or favored
* one character is blamed, ridiculed, excluded, snubbed, or diminished
* a comparison clearly puts one character above or below another
* a character gains or loses rhetorical or emotional leverage
* association with another figure clearly raises or lowers local standing

Bad reasons to create a separate event:

* a subordinate nuance merely restates the same local movement
* a quoted phrase provides color but not a distinct appraisal act
* a possible counter-reading is present but not central
* a nearby character is involved in the scene but not in the main evaluative movement
* one sentence offers several pieces of evidence for the same local movement
* the same movement could be described with several nearby labels

Prefer these broad labels when possible:

* `narrated_diminishment`
* `narrated_elevation`
* `snub`
* `admiration`
* `blame`
* `prestige_association`
* `discredit_association`

Avoid finer-grained labels unless the passage truly demands them.
Choose the **single best label** for the dominant movement rather than enumerating nearby alternatives.

### `status_effects`

Use these dimensions only. Each is governed by its own criterion:

* `general_appraisal` — the passage's evaluative verdict on a character:
  praised, admired, ridiculed, or discredited in the narration or the scene.
* `rhetorical_position` — the upper hand in talk: wit that lands or misfires,
  an argument won or lost, a line that silences or is silenced.
* `emotional_position` — emotional leverage in a relation: who needs, who
  withholds, who suffers visibly, who controls.
* `social_status` — a movement or display of standing that is **witnessed
  inside the world of the passage**. Someone present — or society's reported
  voice — must register it: deference given or withheld, a reception or
  invitation that marks rank, a public snub, a reputation spoken of as risen
  or fallen. A private, unshared judgment of a character is
  `general_appraisal`, not `social_status`.
* `inclusion_exclusion` — a **boundary event**: an interior with an
  exterior, and a character shown crossing that line or barred at it —
  introduced or not introduced, greeted or cut, invited or left out, absorbed
  into the group or held at its edge. The boundary need not belong to a
  social set: the family table, a household, a bedroom door, a clan, a club,
  a box at the theatre, the circle of a conversation, the intimacy of
  tutoiement, an institution, a nation, a clandestine fraternity — all count,
  so long as the passage shows an inside, an outside, and this character's
  position across that line changing. Mere
  presence at a gathering is not inclusion, and absence is not exclusion;
  the boundary itself must be shown moving for this character.

Create status effects only when there is meaningful local movement.
Record **every distinct movement that meets its dimension's criterion**.
Most characters will still have 1 status effect, some 2; a dense social
scene may genuinely support more. There is no fixed cap, but distinctness
is strict:

* Two effects in the **same dimension** for one character are allowed only
  when they arise from clearly separate moments of the passage — different
  events, different witnesses, a different boundary — and could not honestly
  be summarized as one movement. Each must cite different `based_on_events`.
  When in doubt, summarize as one.
* Never restate one social fact as several effects.
* For one character, a single event grounds at most **one** effect among
  `general_appraisal`, `emotional_position`, and `rhetorical_position`:
  these are facets of the same contest, so choose the dimension that best
  names the movement rather than recording several facets of it.
* An event supports a dimension only when it meets that dimension's
  criterion, not when it merely brushes it.
* Do not collapse a real standing or belonging movement into
  `general_appraisal` to economize: a witticism that wins the room may be
  both `rhetorical_position` for the duel and `social_status` for the
  standing it visibly confers — record each on its own merits.

`delta` should reflect local movement in the passage:

Status delta:

* -2 = clearly diminished in this passage
* -1 = somewhat diminished
* 0 = do not use — if there is no clear movement, record no effect at all: null is not zero
* +1 = somewhat elevated
* +2 = clearly elevated

### `ambiguities`

Use this list to record uncertainty such as:

* ironic or layered narration
* uncertain evaluator
* ambiguous target
* uncertain reference resolution (who a surface form refers to)
* unclear endorsement by narrator or social voice

Default to an empty list.
Only add an ambiguity when it materially changes how the event or status effect should be read.
Do not use `ambiguities` for routine caveats or general interpretive hedging.
Usually return an empty list.

### Confidence

* 0.0 to 1.0
* Be conservative when irony, layered narration, or reference resolution makes interpretation unstable.

## Important rules

* Named characters, plus only the reviewed unnamed figures on the reference sheet.
* Use the reference sheet's canonical names where a referent matches; use the
  passage's surface form verbatim with `"resolution": "unresolved"` where it
  does not. Never silently drop a materially involved character.
* `"resolution": "resolved"` may be omitted (it is the default); always state
  `"resolution": "unresolved"` explicitly.
* If a surface form is ambiguous, mention that in "ambiguities."
* Do not infer broad character arcs.
* Do not force zero-sum logic.
* A single event may affect both source and target, but record that through separate status effects if needed.
* Ignore trivial mentions that do not meaningfully alter evaluation or status.
* Do not add a winner/loser verdict field.
* Do not add a summary object.
* If there is no meaningful status movement, keep `appraisal_events` and `status_effects` empty rather than inventing a weak event.
* When narrator framing clearly guides the judgment, do not default to `neutral_report`.
* Do not turn one dominant movement into a chain of micro-events.
* Do not add balancing positive and negative effects unless both are central to the passage.
* Do not annotate every evaluatively charged phrase.
* Multiple quotations can support one event.
* If you are unsure between several event labels, pick the broadest stable one.

## Compression examples

These examples illustrate the intended first-pass compression.

Example A:

If a passage reveals that Swann is far more socially eminent than the family realizes, do **not** split this into:

* one event for narrator elevation
* one event for aristocratic association
* one event for local under-recognition

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_elevation`
* `1` main status effect: `social_status +2`

Example B:

If a passage exposes Legrandin’s evasive, socially defensive performance, do **not** split this into:

* ridicule
* humiliation
* blame
* rhetorical weakness
* emotional vulnerability

Instead, prefer:

* `1` event: `narrated_diminishment`
* `1` or `2` status effects at most, only if both are central

Example C:

If a passage shows Swann reaching long-desired intimacy with Odette through awkward pretext, hesitation, or dependence, do **not** reduce it to:

* one event for timidity
* one event for dependence
* one event for social compromise

Instead, prefer:

* `1` central event that preserves the realized intimacy or renewal
* a positive `emotional_position` effect when that attainment is the dominant local outcome
* a secondary note about hesitation or compromise only if it is itself central
* do **not** promote mere reunion relief unless the passage clearly crosses into intimacy or explicit renewal
* do **not** let a brief closing uplift outweigh the dominant movement of the passage unless that culminating turn is clearly the passage's main point

Example D:

If a passage shows a guest turned away at a hostess's door and then dwells
on that same refusal — the guest's confusion, the footman's repeated
message, the slow walk back down the staircase — that is **one** boundary
event:

* `1` event: `snub`
* `1` status effect: `inclusion_exclusion -2`

But if the same passage later shows the assembled room deferring to a newly
arrived title, that is a separate witnessed movement, for a different
character, grounded in its own event — record it on its own merits.

### Prior local context (optional)

Mais à ce nom de Guermantes, je vis au milieu des yeux bleus de notre ami se ficher une petite encoche brune comme s’ils venaient d’être percés par une pointe invisible, tandis que le reste de la prunelle réagissait en sécrétant des flots d’azur. Le cerne de sa paupière noircit, s’abaissa. Et sa bouche marquée d’un pli amer se ressaisissant plus vite sourit, tandis que le regard restait douloureux, comme celui d’un beau martyr dont le corps est hérissé de flèches : « Non, je ne les connais pas », dit-il, mais au lieu de donner à un renseignement aussi simple, à une réponse aussi peu surprenante le ton naturel et courant qui convenait, il le débita en appuyant sur les mots, en s’inclinant, en saluant de la tête, à la fois avec l’insistance qu’on apporte, pour être cru, à une affirmation invraisemblable — comme si ce fait qu’il ne connût pas les Guermantes ne pouvait être l’effet que d’un hasard singulier — et aussi avec l’emphase de quelqu’un qui, ne pouvant pas taire une situation qui lui est pénible, préfère la proclamer pour donner aux autres l’idée que l’aveu qu’il fait ne lui cause aucun embarras, est facile, agréable, spontané, que la situation elle-même — l’absence de relations avec les Guermantes — pourrait bien avoir été non pas subie, mais voulue par lui, résulter de quelque tradition de famille, principe de morale ou vœu mystique lui interdisant nommément la fréquentation des Guermantes. « Non, reprit-il, expliquant par ses paroles sa propre intonation, non, je ne les connais pas, je n’ai jamais voulu, j’ai toujours tenu à sauvegarder ma pleine indépendance ; au fond je suis une tête jacobine, vous le savez. Beaucoup de gens sont venus à la rescousse, on me disait que j’avais tort de ne pas aller à Guermantes, que je me donnais l’air d’un malotru, d’un vieil ours. Mais voilà une réputation qui n’est pas pour m’effrayer, elle est si vraie ! Au fond, je n’aime plus au monde que quelques églises, deux ou trois livres, à peine davantage de tableaux, et le clair de lune quand la brise de votre jeunesse apporte jusqu’à moi l’odeur des parterres que mes vieilles prunelles ne distinguent plus. » Je ne comprenais pas bien que, pour ne pas aller chez des gens qu’on ne connaît pas, il fût nécessaire de tenir à son indépendance, et en quoi cela pouvait vous donner l’air d’un sauvage ou d’un ours. Mais ce que je comprenais, c’est que Legrandin n’était pas tout à fait véridique quand il disait n’aimer que les églises, le clair de lune et la jeunesse ; il aimait beaucoup les gens des châteaux et se trouvait pris devant eux d’une si grande peur de leur déplaire qu’il n’osait pas leur laisser voir qu’il avait pour amis des bourgeois, des fils de notaires ou d’agents de change, préférant, si la vérité devait se découvrir, que ce fût en son absence, loin de lui et « par défaut » ; il était snob. Sans doute il ne disait jamais rien de tout cela dans le langage que mes parents et moi-même nous aimions tant. Et si je demandais : « Connaissez-vous les Guermantes ? », Legrandin le causeur répondait : « Non je n’ai jamais voulu les connaître. » Malheureusement il ne le répondait qu’en second, car un autre Legrandin qu’il cachait soigneusement au fond de lui, qu’il ne montrait pas, parce que ce Legrandin-là savait sur le nôtre, sur son snobisme, des histoires compromettantes, un autre Legrandin avait déjà répondu par la blessure du regard, par le rictus de la bouche, par la gravité excessive du ton de la réponse, par les mille flèches dont notre Legrandin s’était trouvé en un instant lardé et alangui, comme un saint Sébastien du snobisme : « Hélas ! que vous me faites mal ! non je ne connais pas les Guermantes, ne réveillez pas la grande douleur de ma vie. » Et comme ce Legrandin enfant terrible, ce Legrandin maître chanteur, s’il n’avait pas le joli langage de l’autre, avait le verbe infiniment plus prompt, composé de ce qu’on appelle « réflexes », quand Legrandin le causeur voulait lui imposer silence, l’autre avait déjà parlé et notre ami avait beau se désoler de la mauvaise impression que les révélations de son alter ego avaient dû produire, il ne pouvait qu’entreprendre de la pallier.

### Passage

Et certes cela ne veut pas dire que M. Legrandin ne fût pas sincère quand il tonnait contre les snobs. Il ne pouvait pas savoir, au moins par lui-même, qu’il le fût, puisque nous ne connaissons jamais que les passions des autres, et que ce que nous arrivons à savoir des nôtres, ce n’est que d’eux que nous avons pu l’apprendre. Sur nous, elles n’agissent que d’une façon seconde, par l’imagination qui substitue aux premiers mobiles des mobiles de relais qui sont plus décents. Jamais le snobisme de Legrandin ne lui conseillait d’aller voir souvent une duchesse. Il chargeait l’imagination de Legrandin de lui faire apparaître cette duchesse comme parée de toutes les grâces. Legrandin se rapprochait de la duchesse, s’estimant de céder à cet attrait de l’esprit et de la vertu qu’ignorent les infâmes snobs. Seuls les autres savaient qu’il en était un ; car grâce à l’incapacité où ils étaient de comprendre le travail intermédiaire de son imagination, ils voyaient en face l’une de l’autre l’activité mondaine de Legrandin et sa cause première.

Maintenant, à la maison, on n’avait plus aucune illusion sur M. Legrandin, et nos relations avec lui s’étaient fort espacées. Maman s’amusait infiniment chaque fois qu’elle prenait Legrandin en flagrant délit du péché qu’il n’avouait pas, qu’il continuait à appeler le péché sans rémission, le snobisme. Mon père, lui, avait de la peine à prendre les dédains de Legrandin avec tant de détachement et de gaîté ; et quand on pensa une année à m’envoyer passer les grandes vacances à Balbec avec ma grand’mère, il dit : « Il faut absolument que j’annonce à Legrandin que vous irez à Balbec, pour voir s’il vous offrira de vous mettre en rapport avec sa sœur. Il ne doit pas se souvenir nous avoir dit qu’elle demeurait à deux kilomètres de là. » Ma grand’mère qui trouvait qu’aux bains de mer il faut être du matin au soir sur la plage à humer le sel et qu’on n’y doit connaître personne, parce que les visites, les promenades sont autant de pris sur l’air marin, demandait au contraire qu’on ne parlât pas de nos projets à Legrandin, voyant déjà sa sœur, Mme de Cambremer, débarquant à l’hôtel au moment où nous serions sur le point d’aller à la pêche et nous forçant à rester enfermés pour la recevoir. Mais maman riait de ses craintes, pensant à part elle que le danger n’était pas si menaçant, que Legrandin ne serait pas si pressé de nous mettre en relations avec sa sœur. Or, sans qu’on eût besoin de lui parler de Balbec, ce fut lui-même, Legrandin, qui, ne se doutant pas que nous eussions jamais l’intention d’aller de ce côté, vint se mettre dans le piège un soir où nous le rencontrâmes au bord de la Vivonne.

— Il y a dans les nuages ce soir des violets et des bleus bien beaux, n’est-ce pas, mon compagnon, dit-il à mon père, un bleu surtout plus floral qu’aérien, un bleu de cinéraire, qui surprend dans le ciel. Et ce petit nuage rose n’a-t-il pas aussi un teint de fleur, d’œillet ou d’hydrangéa. Il n’y a guère que dans la Manche, entre Normandie et Bretagne, que j’ai pu faire de plus riches observations sur cette sorte de règne végétal de l’atmosphère. Là-bas près de Balbec, près de ces lieux sauvages, il y a une petite baie d’une douceur charmante où le coucher de soleil du pays d’Auge, le coucher de soleil rouge et or que je suis loin de dédaigner, d’ailleurs, est sans caractère, insignifiant ; mais dans cette atmosphère humide et douce s’épanouissent le soir en quelques instants de ces bouquets célestes, bleus et roses, qui sont incomparables et qui mettent souvent des heures à se faner. D’autres s’effeuillent tout de suite, et c’est alors plus beau encore de voir le ciel entier que jonche la dispersion d’innombrables pétales soufrés ou roses. Dans cette baie, dite d’opale, les plages d’or semblent plus douces encore pour être attachées comme de blondes Andromèdes à ces terribles rochers des côtes voisines, à ce rivage funèbre, fameux par tant de naufrages, où tous les hivers bien des barques trépassent au péril de la mer. Balbec ! la plus antique ossature géologique de notre sol, vraiment Ar-mor, la mer, la fin de la terre, la région maudite qu’Anatole France — un enchanteur que devrait lire notre petit ami — a si bien peinte, sous ses brouillards éternels, comme le véritable pays des Cimmériens, dans l’Odyssée. De Balbec surtout, où déjà des hôtels se construisent, superposés au sol antique et charmant qu’ils n’altèrent pas, quel délice d’excursionner à deux pas dans ces régions primitives et si belles.

— Ah ! est-ce que vous connaissez quelqu’un à Balbec ? dit mon père. Justement ce petit-là doit y aller passer deux mois avec sa grand’mère et peut-être avec ma femme.

Legrandin pris au dépourvu par cette question à un moment où ses yeux étaient fixés sur mon père, ne put les détourner, mais les attachant de seconde en seconde avec plus d’intensité — et tout en souriant tristement — sur les yeux de son interlocuteur, avec un air d’amitié et de franchise et de ne pas craindre de le regarder en face, il sembla lui avoir traversé la figure comme si elle fût devenue transparente, et voir en ce moment bien au delà derrière elle un nuage vivement coloré qui lui créait un alibi mental et qui lui permettrait d’établir qu’au moment où on lui avait demandé s’il connaissait quelqu’un à Balbec, il pensait à autre chose et n’avait pas entendu la question. Habituellement de tels regards font dire à l’interlocuteur : « À quoi pensez-vous donc ? » Mais mon père curieux, irrité et cruel, reprit :
